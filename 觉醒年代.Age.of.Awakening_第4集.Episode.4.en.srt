I have a friend who has a family emergency.

189
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,740
You lend it to me

190
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,940
and just take it out of my salary next month.

191
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:06,529
OK.

192
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,300
Xiang Li!

193
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,580
Go and get thirty silver dollars.

194
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,300
Alright, alright.

195
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,180
Hurry up.

196
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,580
How's your health?

197
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,540
Same as always, OK.

198
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,721
You caught me off guard.

199
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,220
You see, the welcome ceremony is being set up for you.

200
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,100
Good.

201
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:20,820
Here.

202
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,100
Shugui.

203
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,580
Thirty dollars.

204
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:33,700
Brother Ge.

205
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,820
As you said, poor people don't have a fragile life.

206
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,660
Save a life, quickly!

207
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,380
Lao Xie.

208
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,300
You'll also have to lend me ten dollars.

209
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,860
I need to get my stuff

210
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,220
back from the pawnshop.

211
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,660
Hurry up, hurry up and get it.

212
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,780
Good trip. How are you?

213
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,140
Come on, big guy.

214
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,060
We warmly welcome

215
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,700
editor-in-chief Li Dazhao, who has returned from Japan.

216
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:24,861
Good!

217
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:26,097
Good!

218
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,105
Hello.

219
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,420
Student, take a look and see!

220
00:10:29,298 --> 00:10:33,344
[Aurora College, Shanghai]

221
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,420
This issue of the "New Youth"

222
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,660
especially "Youth" by Mr. Li Dazhao

223
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,860
is the most exciting.

224
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,220
Let me read you a paragraph:

225
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,020
"To advance civilisation for the world,"

226
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,180
"to create happiness for mankind,"

227
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,540
"with our youthful selves,"

228
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,700
"to create a youthful family,"

229
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,220
"a youthful nation,"

230
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,500
"a youthful people,"

231
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,580
"a youthful humanity,"

232
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,340
"a youthful earth,"

233
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,340
"a youthful universe..."

234
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,420
Sorry about that!

235
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,140
Who's there?

236
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,500
Did you see if there's anyone up here?

237
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,580
It's her!

238
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,860
The one with the accordion at the back!

239
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,100
That's me.

240
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,300
Did you see anyone down here?

241
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,740
What's going on?

242
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,980
It's wet. The magazines are wet.

243
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,380
I was in a hurry to get to class and didn't see them.

244
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,500
How about this,

245
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,540
I'll give you ten dollars.

246
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,910
You catch!

247
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,340
What an attitude!

248
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,260
Who are you shouting at?

249
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,460
What's wrong with me yelling at you?

250
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,420
Get down here!

251
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,778
Then you wait there.

252
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,260
God there are people like this.

253
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,820
Brother, I'm all wet.

254
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,780
Who are you shouting at?

255
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,820
Do you know what you've done wrong?

256
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,460
Whoever you are, you've drenched the magazine

257
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,259
and you haven't even said you're sorry.

258
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,220
I've given you the money.

259
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,820
I've just made it very clear.

260
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,900
I was in a hurry to get to class, I didn't see it.

261
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,660
I was just up there, I couldn't get down.

262
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,620
What more do you want from me?

263
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,740
Do you give money like that?

264
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,780
I don't mean your money.

265
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,060
It's as much as it should be.

266
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:23,860
Qiaonian, how many copies?

267
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,629
What's your attitude?

268
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:26,630
What's your attitude?

269
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,780
With a woman like you scattering flowers in the sky

270
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,340
and throwing money away?

271
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,220
Thirteen copies.

272
00:12:29,342 --> 00:12:30,073
Thirteen copies.

273
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,140
Twenty-two cents per copy.

274
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,340
How much money?

275
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,220
Two dollars and eighty-six cents.

276
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,140
Add to that the word "Sorry".

277
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,660
I've given you ten dollars.

278
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,180
You can pay for all your magazines for ten dollars.

279
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,260
Ten dollars will get you both a lot of food.

280
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,780
Who wants to go out for dinner on your dime?

281
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:42,900
Do you have any manners

282
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,940
and are you reasonable?

283
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,980
Did your family ever teach you

284
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,100
the rules?

285
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:46,980
Rules, huh?

286
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,900
Then I'll give you a good lecture on the rules today.

287
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:49,860
This is a school.

288
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,060
You have broken a school rule.

289
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,180
The school rule is

290
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,460
that no one is allowed to set up a stall here.

291
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,380
You've set up a stall and you're in breach of school rules.

292
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,900
I'm still really surprised.

293
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,940
Who are you?

294
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,820
What are you doing?

295
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,900
I suddenly remembered that I hadn't met you guys before.

296
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,180
Sister, how did you get here?

297
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,460
Sister, we are new students.

298
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,580
New students, are you?

299
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,340
New students are expected to follow the school rules.

300
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,100
The new students don't study hard,

301
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,020
they just set up shop and do business here

302
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,380
which will delay their studies.

303
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,220
How can you live up to the parents who provide for you?

304
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,980
Who doesn't study well anymore?

305
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,300
We call this work-study after school.

306
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,620
French class is a preparatory class for work-study in France.

307
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,060
Then we can work-study in France

308
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,180
but not in our own country.

309
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,220
What's the point?

310
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,420
Work-study?

311
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,860
That's a trendy way of putting it.

312
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,020
There are rules everywhere in China.

313
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,620
School rules are school rules.

314
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,780
Yes, we are new students

315
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,580
and we don't know the rules.

316
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,540
But now that we know

317
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,260
we can walk

318
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,020
but before that happens, you have to say one word to us.

319
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,220
"Sorry"

320
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,740
We'll leave as soon as we've finished.

321
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,180
I've grown up

322
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,540
and never said that word.

323
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,140
Are you leaving?

324
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,020
I'm not leaving.

325
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,060
OK.

326
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,020
Supervisor!

327
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,140
Sister, don't!

328
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,100
Don't stop her. Let her shout.

329
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,820
Sister, don't shout.

330
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,353
Shout!

331
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,100
Supervisor!

332
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:52,740
Sister, don't shout.

333
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,780
We are not like the others.

334
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,540
The "New Youth" magazine is an emancipator of the mind!

335
00:13:54,592 --> 00:13:56,433
[Chen Qiaonian, second son of Chen Duxiu]

336
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,820
Do you know Mr. Li Dazhao?

337
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,020
I don't know Li Dazhao.

338
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,383
You leaving?

339
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,315
Not leaving.

340
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,860
OK, hold this for me.

341
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,340
Don't do this.

342
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,460
Not leaving, are you?

343
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,900
I'll do it.

344
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,260
Sister!

345
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,860
What are you doing? You want to go insane?

346
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,700
I didn't ask for trouble.

347
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,500
The students are watching

348
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,220
while I reasoned with her.

349
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,180
I'm not being a jerk.

350
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,100
Put the magazines down.

351
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,540
You're a stubborn person.

352
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,660
There's no reasoning with you!

353
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,700
Why do you have no sense at all?

354
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,980
Sister, don't take our things!

355
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,940
Have a good talk!

356
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,380
You give me back the magazine!

357
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,220
Sister!

358
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,180
Make way!

359
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,740
Brother, let's sell it somewhere else.

360
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,020
Don't sell it here.

361
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,220
Alright.

362
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,580
Sell it there and nowhere else.

363
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,500
Here you go.

364
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,380
Thank you.

365
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,540
Grandpa,

366
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,740
I'll set up a stall here

367
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,660
to sell "New Youth" magazines.

368
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,220
What?

369
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,060
I want a stall here selling magazines,

370
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,100
is it a concern for you?

371
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,300
Selling books.

372
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,580
What book?

373
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,620
"New Youth"

374
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,300
Sell it, sell it.

375
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,580
Thank you!

376
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,380
To love or not to love.

377
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,740
It's not easy to watch them.

378
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,020
They are the ones who work and study.

379
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,460
Let's all disperse and get on with it.

380
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,740
Close the door.

381
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,620
Take a look and see!

382
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,060
Don't miss it passing by!

383
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,460

386
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,380
Young man, how much is the magazine?

387
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,660
Hello, twenty-two cents a copy.

388
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,100
Come and have a look.

389
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,980
I'll take a look.

390
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,460
Yes, I'll take one.

391
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,420
Twenty-two cents.

392
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,907
That's it. Thank you.

00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,184
Have a good read. Qianian, receipt!

394
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,447
OK.

396
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,100

00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,380
Twenty-two cents a copy.

00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,020

Thank you!

409
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,620
Brother, I've got one here too.

410
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,620
Don't mess it up.

411
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,100
"New Youth"!

412
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,500
See Mr. Li Dazhao's "Youth"!

413
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,140
This is a well written paragraph.

414
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,460
Stop, stop, stop.

415
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,260
See Mr. Li Dazhao's "Youth"!

416
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,340
See the newly published "New Youth"!

417
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:30,980
Young man.

418
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,660
Let me ask you something.

419
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,020
Do you have

420
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,100
the newly reissued issue

421
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,020
of the magazine that published

422
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,580
Li Dazhao's "Youth"?

423
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,460
Sure thing.

424
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:40,900
Let me have a look.

425
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,380
Go ahead.

426
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,900
Many people like it. They're buying the magazine

427
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,700
just for that article.

428
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,260
Yes. That's the one.

429
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,780
The Master had me looking for it for several days.

430
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,740
Finally found it.

431
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,100
I'll buy two issues.

432
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,380
Two?

433
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,100
How much?

434
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:54,660
Here you go.

435
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,700
Forty-four cents all together.

436
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,740
Twenty-two cents each.

437
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:57,700
Alright.

438
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,820
This one is new. Take it.

439
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:01,860
Here.

440
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,860
No problem. It's ok if you don't buy it.

441
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,500
You can read it first.

442
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,460
You can't stop here. Move along.

443
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,980
Right away.

444
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,900
Mister, we have to go.

445
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,380
Coming!

446
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,260
Here's your change.

447
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:18,900
Here.

448
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,700
Thank you!

449
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,420
Take care.

450
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,060
Alrighty.

451
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,500
Alright, here you go.

452
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,300
Qiaonian,

453
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,100
are you keeping track?

454
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,220
That's another two issues.

455
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,500
Yes.

456
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,740
I've got a few too.

457
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:41,816
[Baishun Lane, Qianmenwei Street, Beijing]

458
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,940
Brothers,

459
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,060
Let's not go to second-rate tea rooms.

460
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,260
And let's not go to third-rate lodgings.

461
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,380
But rather to this first-rate sing-song house!

462
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,180
Lan Xiang Ban!

463
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,020
Gui Jin Luan!

464
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,900
Young Masters, be quiet.

465
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,700
Your brother is here!

466
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,340
Young Masters.

467
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,620
Master Zhang, to tell you the truth,

468
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,860
right now, Gui Jin Luan

469
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,180
is entertaining Master Hu from your Peking University.

470
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,220
The music is coming from her room.

471
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,380
Master Hu?

472
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,460
Which Master Hu?

473
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,540
The Master Hu from Peking University, Hu Jun.

474
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:31,940
That's right.

475
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,540
He's been here for several days.

476
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,060
Hu Jun?

477
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,140
I know him!

478
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,420
He got a professorship due to his relative Duan Qirui.

479
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,380
Taking money and not teaching properly.

480
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,460
Spending all day eating, drinking, and gambling,

481
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,820
his reputation stinks to high heaven.

482
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,820
Since he's been here for a few days,

483
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,580
then ask him to take a break.

484
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,740
Let's give him a hand.

485
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,980
Besides, as a teacher,

486
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,820
he ought to defer to students.

487
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,660
Get out of the way.

488
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:08,500
Master Zhang, Master Zhang!

489
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,700
What are you doing just standing there?

490
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,820
Hurry up and call the police!

491
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,540
Master Zhang!

492
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,740
Stop fighting!

493
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,900
Help!

494
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:27,666
[Shanghai]

495
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,940
There's a purse here.

496
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,500
Where did you find it?

497
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,540
Inside the book.

498
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,860
Do you have any recollection

499
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,300
of anyone who was here with that purse?

500
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,500
Can't remember.

501
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,860
Five hundred and eighty-three silver dollars.

502
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,660
So much money.

503
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,540
Five eighty-three!

504
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,100
Quiet!

505
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,540
Let me count it.

506
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,700
Song Ah Di.

507
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,900
There's no address. Only a name.

508
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,940
If no one claims it, then we've hit the jackpot.

509
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,220
Hit what jackpot?

510
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,460
If you had lost this money, wouldn't you be worried?

511
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,940
Then how do we give it back?

512
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,020
Let's wait.

513
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,100
See if anyone comes to claim it.

514
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,260
Clean up.

515
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,540
Not going home?

516
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,420
We'll be going right away.

517
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,780
It's getting dark.

518
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,820
Should get going.

519
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:19,780
Take care.

520
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,140
See you tomorrow.

521
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,380
Friends, friends.

522
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,940
Have a drink. No, no.

523
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,940
Why not?

524
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,820
Just sit there, then.

525
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,300
Brother.

526
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,320
Hungry.

527
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,980
Bear with it.

528
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,100
What if I'm still hungry?

529
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,700
Are you hungry?

530
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,900
I...

531
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,820
I'm also hungry.

532
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,020
Then how do you bear your hunger?

533
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,700
With all my might.

534
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,300
Little mister.

535
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,820
Aren't you the uncle who bought that magazine.

536
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:27,860
Yes, yes.

537
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,700
Little misters, have you seen my purse?

538
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,060
First of all, calm down.

539
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,420
What does your purse look like?

540
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,620
It's brown.

541
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,580
And filled with the Master's silver certificates.

542
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,860
You can stop looking.

543
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,460
Is this your purse?

544
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,260
That's exactly it.

545
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,780
I can't just give it to you.

546
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,060
I have to ask you a few questions.

547
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,820
Sure, as you should.

548
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,580
Go ahead and ask.

549
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,700
What do you have

550
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,740
inside this purse?

551
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,780
Six silver certificates.

552
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,620
Five hundred and eighty-three silver dollars all together.

553
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,700
It's a divident from the soap factory.

554
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,740
Only silver certificates?

555
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,860
Are there any silver coins?

556
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,300
Only certificates, no coins.

557
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,540
Is there anything else besides that?

558
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,740
There is also a bill

559
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,020
with my name on it.

560
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,100
My name is Song Ah Di.

561
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,420
What you've said all matches up. You can count it.

562
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
It's all here.

563
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,660
Thank heavens.

564
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,740
My master's money has finally been found.

565
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,380
Thank you both.

566
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,100
Mister,

567
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,900
you don't need to be like this.

568
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,180
Thank you both young gentlemen.

569
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,420
You've really saved this old man's life.

570
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,260
I had thought that

571
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,860
if I couldn't find this money

572
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,780
I'd have to jump in the Huangpu river.

573
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,500
Don't be like this.

574
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,700
It's good enough that you got it back.

575
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,980
You're welcome.

576
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,580
Why don't you put it away,

577
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,540
and get back home quickly.

578
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,700
Young gentlemen,

579
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,620
please go with me to see my master.

580
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,060
He will definitely reward you.

581
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:51,860
No, no.

582
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,620
It's nothing. There's no need for a reward.

583
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,820
You should go back home.

584
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,100
We have to go back to the school.

585
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,060
But, but.

586
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,180
Young gentlemen,

587
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,460
let's see this to the end.

588
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,620
Look, it's already dark.

589
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,340
It's not safe for an old man

590
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,780
to be carrying so much money.

591
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,260
Would you two please escort me home?

592
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,500
Brother, let's see the uncle home.

593
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,900
Let's go.

594
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,660
Don't worry. Let me give you a hand.

595
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,540
This way.

596
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,780

598
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,020
This way, gentlemen.

599

We're almost there.

601

Let us help.

602
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,380
No need.

603
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:41,780
Uncle Song.

604
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,300
You've got your own work.

605
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:44,980
Here.

606
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,140
We're here.

607
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,500
Please come in.

608
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,860
Here, young gentlemen.

609
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,180
Please.

610
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,020
Right this way.

611
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,220
Uncle, now that the money has been safely delivered,

612
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,420
we should be on our way.

613
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,700
Not at all.

614
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,980
Now that you're already here,

615
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,620
I would like to ask you two to help me testify.

616
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,700
Without you present, I can't explain it properly.

617
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,620
Master will say I'm lying.

618
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,740
Alright.

619
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,220
Here, put it down.

620
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,420
You put it down too.

621
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,540
Here, take a seat.

622
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,900
A seat here. Alright.

623
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,180
Bring out the coffee.

624
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,260
Young gentlemen, please wait.

625
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,540
I will find the Master.

626
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,140
Please, sit.

627
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,060
Master!

628
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,980
Please, the coffee.

629
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,860
Thank you.

630
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,900
I'm hungry.

631
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,900
Bear it.

632
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,700
I know.

633
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,820
Why are you two here?

634
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,060
Why are you here?

635
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,060
What do you mean, why?

636
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,580
This is my home.

637
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,860
What are you two doing here?

638
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,620
This is your home?

639
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,940
Mother, these are the two scoundrels from today

640
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,980
I was telling you about.

641
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,260
Who's the scoundrel?

642
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,780
Can't you tell the truth for once?

643
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,460
Who spilled the water all over us today?

644
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,940
I did spill the water. Didn't I give you money?

645
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,540
Is that the way to give us money?

646
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,740
Then how should I have done it?

647
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,420
Fellow student, you have still not understood

648
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,180
how you are wrong, have you?

649
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,300
Who has wronged whom?

650
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,380
Setting up stalls without permission is in violation of school rules.

651
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,140
You've brought your wares here.

652
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,460
Were you going to set up a street stall in my home?

653
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,060
Set it up then.

654
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,420
Child, don't speak this way.

655
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,180
This way, Master.

656
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,820
Master, these are the two young gentlemen.

657
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,180
This is our Master.

658
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,940
How do you do?

659
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,100
How should address the two of you?

660
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,460
I am Chen Qiaonian.

661
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:48,980
Chen Yannian.

662
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,380
Thank you both.

663
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,740
Thank you. You're welcome.

664
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,820
Dad, why are you thanking them?

665
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,780
These are the two

666
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,460
who were arguing with me at school.

667
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,460
They were setting up a stall to sell things.

668
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,820
I kicked them out.

669
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,740
Sister, didn't we already explain to you

670
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,900
that our stall is a work-study program.

671
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,660
You've already violated the school rules.

672
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,260
What work can you do? What student can you be?

673
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,540
Liu Mei!

674
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,060
These are our guests!

675
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,140
How can you speak to guests in such a way?

676
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,500
How rude!

677
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,980
Please have a seat.

678
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,220
Alright.

679
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,300
Sit, sit!

680
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,260
Old Song has told me everything.

681
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,540
The two of you, by not pocketing the money,

682
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,940
have really helped our family.

683
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,180
I must thank you properly.

684
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,460
Old Song.

685
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,740
Master.

686
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,780
This small gift is a token of my regard.

687
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,060
Please take it.

688
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,420
We can't take the money.

689
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,260
We did what we ought to do.

690
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,780
If we really wanted money,

691
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,780
couldn't we have gotten more with the five hundred?

692
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,260
Now that the money has been safely returned,

693
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,860
we are going to go now.

694
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,420
Uncle, we will take our leave.

695
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,860
Wait, don't go.

696
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,100
The both of you,

697
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,220
stay, stay.

698
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,420
I've heard you say

699
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,660
that you are doing a work-study program.

700
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,060
Then you must have some financial difficulties.

701
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,540
If you insist on refusing this money,

702
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,820
why don't we do this. I am the administrator at the school.

703
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,820
I can waive all of your

704
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,620
tuition and miscellaneous fees.

705
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,140
It's a matter of course to pay for tuition if attending school.

706
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,500
We pay what should be paid.

707
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,260
We'll figure it out ourselves.

708
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,860
Thank you for your kindness.

00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,300

00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:49,460
Wen Yao, is there anything to eat?

712
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,580
I'm starving.

What are you doing here?

716
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,900
Old Wu, do you know these two?

717
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,060
Far more than know!

718
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,820
These two are Chen Duxiu's sons.

719
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,580
Chen Yannian. Chen Qiaonian.

720
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,300
So they are Chen Duxiu's young masters!

721
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,380
No wonder.

722
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,060

723
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,660
he is his own person, and we are us.

724
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,340
We don't have anything to do with him.

725
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,940
We're going back to school now.

726
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,860
Any later and the school gate will be closed.

732
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,180
How did they end up here with you?

733
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,740

It's not weasels, then what is it?

749
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,586
A silly lump.

750
00:31:55,588 --> 00:31:56,703
[Zhao Renlan, wife of Li Dazhao]

751
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,501
Miss. The silly lump has come back.

752
00:32:04,043 --> 00:32:05,414
Came back...

753
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,380
I thought you would only be able to come back at night.

754
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,540
When I look at it, there is nothing wrong.

755
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,540
I changed my to ticket to an early morning one.

756
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,260
Rented a donkey cart. Getting on there's also no people.

757
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,180
In no time, I was pulled to our house entrance.

758
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,300
Fast.

759
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,900
The fire... firewood pile.

760
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,060
Those siberian weasels have been coming to the firewood pile.

761
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,060
Xinghua, Xinghua's been bitten by them.

762
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,500
Her, her brother grabs a stick

763
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,700
driving away and hurrying over there

764
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,820
to find weasels

765
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,060
Hurry, come here!

766
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,500
This is your guys' dad!

767
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,500
Don't you guys shout to want to find your dad all the time?

768
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,780
Hurry over, call for "dad".

769
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,460
Dad's back.

770
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,747
Dad's come back. Quickly.

771
00:32:40,942 --> 00:32:41,419
Quickly.

772
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,286
Hurry to the front. Quickly go and call dad.

773
00:32:44,287 --> 00:32:45,286
Hurry, go!

774
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,740
Xinghua.

775
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,699
Dad!

776
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,069
You...

777
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:07,139
This child, all day who do you keep shouting at?

778
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:07,540
Want you dad, want your dad. Go search.

779
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,660
Dad's come, and you...

780
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,940
You stay in your den.

781
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,620
You quickly!

782
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,060
Stop being stubborn there.

783
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,580
You, quickly go.

784
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,260
Li Baohua

785
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,660
Are you still wetting your bed right now?

786
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,260
Xinghua, Xinghua, Xinghua!

787
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,540
Enough now, enough now.

788
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,580
Come down, come down.

789
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,340
Don't let your dad hold you.

790
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,780
Dad's tired. Quickly.

791
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,100
Wash your face, wash your face.

792
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,180
Dad's washing his face, is that okay?

793
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,140
Dad's going to wash his hands.

794
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,140
Then I'll hold you again, is that okay?

795
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,580
Good.

796
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,300
Xinghua, catch a big chaffinch.

797
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,420
Slaughter chicken!

798
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,500
Tonight we're eating chicken!

799
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,020
Slaughter chicken!

800
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:16,020
Our... our family can finally eat a reunion meal.

801
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,700
Student Li Baohua.

802
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,860
Come out and catch chicken.

803
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,060
Stop it over there!

804
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,420
Let me help, miss.

805
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,380
No problem.

806
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,740
Dad, what is this?

807
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,220
This is called Junqi (land battle chess).

808
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,460
Dad, why didn't buy me something good to eat?

809
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,580
Didn't you eat all the big reed flowers, you still want to eat something good?

810
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,180
How much good food are you able to eat?

811
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,060
But this land battle chess, we can play with it for a long time.

812
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,820
Do you guys know?

813
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,420
When dad was in Japan,

814
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,740
everyone relied on this to relieve boredom.

815
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:58,100
Baohua, don't think that this land battle chess doesn't look good.

816
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,060
This is what dad personally made for you.

817
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,462
Dad will teach you, okay?

818
00:35:02,462 --> 00:35:03,182
Okay

819
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,100
This Junqi

820
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,860
needs to have two people to battle.

821
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,620
What's a victory?

822
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,820
I take this piece,

823
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,740
occupy your military command center.

824
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,100
This is a victory.

825
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,260
You see these pieces on the chessboard,

826
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,820
The biggest piece within these pieces is this one.

827
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,820
General.

828
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,660
The last one is this one, landmine.

829
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,580
Landmine, excluding the military engineer,

830
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,260
is afraid of no one.

831
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,100
Xinghua.

832
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:31,860
It's burning hot.

833
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,740
Do you understand?

834
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,940
Understand.

835
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:34,420
Come.

836
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,620
I'll teach you how to move.

837
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,740
Dad, drink water.

838
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,980
Thank you, Xinghua!

839
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,180
Dad, what is the biggest move?

840
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,020
Just now, didn't dad tell you?

841
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:46,740
General.

842
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,900
Dad. Then when can you become the biggest official?

843
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,700
Like this, then we can eat meat every day.

844
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,300
Who said dad wanted to be an official?

845
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,060
Didn't the village people all say？

846
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,900
Studying is so you can become a big official.

847
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,740
Dad, aren't you this village's

848
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,780
person who reads the most.

849
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,780
For sure, you can be the biggest official.

850
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,940
Dad, after you become a big official,

851
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,380
won't we have money then.

852
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,540
When the time comes, can you buy me fruit candy to eat.

853
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,620
Second girl let me have a lick,

854
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,980
it was especially good.

855
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:14,900
Come.

856
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,740
Saying it like this,

857
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,500
you guys all want dad to become an official.

858
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,340
Being an official is incredible!

859
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,020
And there's money!

860
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,180
Is being an official is incredible?

861
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,700
Baohua, just now dad taught you land battle chess.

862
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,380
Who do you think is the most incredible in here?

863
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,580
General.

864
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,540
Not right.

865
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,380
General is afraid of the landmine.

866
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,180
Right.

867
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,780
Then, the landmine is the most incredible.

868
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,860
Then who is the landmine afraid of?

869
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,540
The landmine is afraid of the military engineer.

870
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,140
Oh right!

871
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,740
Then military engineer is the most incredible.

872
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,820
That's not right.

873
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,340
After the military engineer removes the landmine,

874
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,100
it will die with whoever it meets!

875
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,460
What you said is correct.

876
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,980
The military engineer acting alone

877
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,100
is surely the weakest.

878
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,540
But the military engineer

879
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,260
can make a lot of incredible weapons.

880
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,860
You guys think about it.

881
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,020
A pile of military engineers stacked together

882
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,020
can create many, many different kinds

883
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,020
of weapons in one piece.

884
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,740
Then officials, aren't they afraid of them?

885
00:37:07,714 --> 00:37:08,714
Afraid.

886
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,420
So although second girl's father is a small town official

887
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,020
but her when her mom and grandmother

888
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,620
grabs a broom, he will run.

889
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,940
Therefore, later dad will become a military engineer.

890
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,780
Xinghua, Baohua.

891
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,260
After you guys grow up

892
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,780
No matter if you become a military engineer or something else.

893
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,100
It is up to you to decide.

894
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,380
But remember,

895
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,180
no matter what we become,

896
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,540
we need to be a strong and disciplined person.

897
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,580
We need to be

898
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,980
a person who never harms ordinary people.

899
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,300
This is a present Dad gives to you.

900
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,260
Thank you, Dad!

901
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,020
What thank you? Take a look.

902
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,700
Such a beautiful case.

903
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,380
Case is very beautiful

904
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,660
Recently, a friend

905
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,140
made me go to Nanjing to be an official.

906
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,900
It is said that it's a lucrative job.

907
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,420
Income is also pretty high.

908
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,020
But I declined it.

909
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,860
I said the warlords right now

910
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,068
cause damage to the country and suffering to the people,

911
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,500
having the ordinary people deal with their days so bitterly.

912
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,820
When I was returning back from Japan,

913
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,180
I made a malicious oath.

914
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,860
Even if I die,

915
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,660
I will never follow their bad example.

916
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,300
You won't blame me right?

917
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,980
I listen to you.

918
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,900
I know you won't do things that will cause harm to the ordinary people.

919
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,940
We can't let other people stab us in the back, right?

920
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,660
Do what you want to do.

921
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,220
Us three mother and children you... You don't need to worry.

922
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,540
In the countryside, we can get through anything.

923
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,540
Then... when you become an official,

924
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,620
what plans do you have?

925
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,660
I plan to go back to Beijing and continue running my magazine.

926
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,700
Although, I say it doesn't earn as much as an official,

927
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,420
But in any case, our food and clothing, we don't need to worry about.

928
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,980
Moreover, that is what I have always wanted to do.

929
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,500
You go steadily do it.

930
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,740
I'll keep watch of this house.

931
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,460
It's just that this work

932
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,700
may have dangers.

933
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,980
Running a magazine, isn't it just dealing with some cultural things?

934
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,180
How can there still be danger?

935
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,380
You know my ambitions...

936
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,420
is for sure not only running a magazine.

937
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,340
I know that you are a person who wants to do big things.

938
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,860
Doing the right things.

939
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,020
You dealing with those cultural thing.

940
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,300
I also can't make sense of what the meaning is.

941
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,420
I am afraid that it will give you an impediment.

942
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,260
How can it?

943
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,300
With you behind my back,

944
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,060
I won't mention much steadiness.

945
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,980
Beijing is cold in winter,

946
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,220
Take this hand stove

947
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,340
to warm up.

948
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,820
I made a case for you

949
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:55,860
Look.

950
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,740
Tie it up this way, and it's nice and warm

951
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,100
and you won't burn your hand.

952
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,540
It's suitable.

953
00:40:10,029 --> 00:40:11,714
[Shanghai]

954
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,260
I bang on the small gong.

955
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,260
Peking University is really nonsense.

956
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,220
Quarrelling from jealousy, hitting each other.

957
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,700
Forced to send Cai Yuanpei

958
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,620
to take over Peking University Hall.

959
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,460
The cultured sweep the floor.

960
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,260
A great country's highest educational institute

961
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,940
has unexpectedly raised such a group of scum.

962
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,940
This country, what hopes does it still have?

963
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,460
Right.

964
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,300
This group of students went as far as to quarrel from jealousy,

965
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,260
striking violently.

966
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,380
What is this? Right!

967
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,140
Exactly.

968
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,300
Too overboard! Exactly!

969
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:54,444
[Beijing]

970
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,940
I... come to you for advice.

971
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,420
Tell me, what do you think Li Yuanhong is doing?

972
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,900
He gave three gold medals

973
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:01,060
to make me hurry to Beijing to take position as Peking University's headmaster.

974
00:40:57,881 --> 00:41:00,841
[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jie Min]

975
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,340
What is the reason?

976
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,660
This President Li Yuanhong

977
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,900
was unbearably mocked by Duan Qirui.

978
00:41:05,182 --> 00:41:06,779
[Wang Daxie, styled Bo Tang, diplomat of the Beiyang government]

979
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,620
He wanted to do something practical to court favors

980
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,700
to compete with Duan Qirui.

981
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,340
Fighting doesn't work here, so his communication

982
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,980
coincided with a scandal at Peking University.

983
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,260
This President Li

984
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,220
took the opportunity to remove Duan Qirui's trusted aide,

985
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,300
Hu Renyuan's, position of headmaster.

986
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,420
Your disciple Fan Yuanlin recommended you,

987
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,900
naturally to obtain popular support.

988
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,380
I know.

989
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,980
The current Peking University,

990
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,820
we can say that it is already rotten to the core.

991
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,500
I just don't want to wade in these muddy waters.

992
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,260
Jiemin says one thing but means another.

993
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,100
Your people are already all in Beijing.

994
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,260
Didn't you just indicate your attitude?

995
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,500
Brother Bo Tang, you know me well.

996
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,420
Frankly saying.

997
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,340
Before going up north,

998
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,900
I specially paid a visit to Mr. Sun Zhongshan.

999
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,540
Mr. Sun said to me that

1000
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:05,140
he hopes that I can turn around Peking University's atmosphere

1001
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,820
and establish a top ranking school that can rise in the world.

1002
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,820
He also hopes that I

1003
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,700
cultivate the banner of China's modern education

1004
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:21,700
and hope that I can soon educate people for the country.

1005
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,780
It's true. Education saves the nation, science saves the nation.

1006
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,220
Talent saves the nation.

1007
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,300
This is exactly the ideal I, Cai Yuanpei, pursue.

1008
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,900
Currently, China has many things waiting to be done.

1009
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,500
Starting first with the atmosphere,

1010
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,980
nothing can surpass the rise of Chen Duxiu's

1011
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,260
New Culture Movement.

1012
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,860
The most appealing

1013
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,500
also can't surpass the high rise of Chen Duxiu's

1014
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,580
banners of both democracy and science.

1015
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,820
Spreading democracy and science.

1016
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,900
The root is in education.

1017
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,380
You, Cai Yuanpei.

1018
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:56,740
If we can use the treasure of Peking University to reform and innovate

1019
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,140
to revive our Chinese nation,

1020
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,220
we will then have a support and hope.

1021
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,140
Brother Bo Tang's words

1022
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,980
is exactly the aspiration of I, Cai Yuanpei.
