00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,796
Where do you live, brother?

6
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,356
Outside Yondingmen, as a pariah.

7
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,876
Why do you say this?

8
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,716
Those who pull carts, wield skill in trade

9
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,036
have shaved heads, are pig butchers, coffin carriers,

10
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,076
all live over there.

11
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,956
Then how is getting by in life right now for you guys?

12
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,316
Impossible to get by. Everyone's suffering until they can't take it anymore.

13
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,516
According to the older generations' saying,

14
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,436
we have never gone through such sullen days.

15
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,316
Didn't you say that since this President Lai has took office,

16
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,516
he has made a lot of promises?

17
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,876
President Lai!

18
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,716
He only cares about fighting with Duan Qirui for power,

19
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,740
he doesn't care about the lives of the people.

20
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,036
Good people, I'm begging you.

21
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,036
My child has high fever for days now.

22

People are worse than animals.

Brother.

26

This is my daughter-in-law!

37
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,996
You can't do that even if she's your daughter-in-law!

What are you doing here?

What's the point of making a fool of yourself here?

40

Am I ashamed? Ge Shugui!

41

If... if I leave, the child will be dead.

We poor people are born to die.

A poor man's life is not a fragile one.

Go!

If you need me in the future, just ask.

107

You don't have to be so polite.

108

Let's get to know each other.

109

There is no distinction between high and low culture.

127
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,436
Sir, how can I be like you?

128
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,180
Look at what you're saying, I can't even answer.

129

You can't say that.

130
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,676
The tough talk on the street just now

131
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,276
had us all in stitches.

132

Right.

133
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,460
Brother Ge is a man with a backbone.

134
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,900
It's coming.

Doctor, how is my son?

139
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,296
Needs hospitalisation.

140
00:06:23,296 --> 00:06:24,236
hospitalisation.

141
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,516
It's so serious!

142
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,716
Don't worry, it's not life-threatening.

143
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,156
You guys go ahead and check in.

144

How much does it cost to get admitted to hospital.

145

I cannot accept.

150
00:07:09,003 --> 00:07:10,476
I cannot accept, Mr. Dazhao!

151
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,356
For your willingness to help us,

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,956
we are already very grateful.

153
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,716
How can we ask you to sell something?

154
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,476
We should do it ourselves!

155
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,956
Do you need to go out on the street if you've got what it takes?

156
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,436
Don't worry, these things don't get in the way of life.

157
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,180
Come.

158
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,436
Short sleeves with missing lapels, few buttons and no buttons,

159

160

No, it won't work!

163

Mr. Dazhao, you can't use this.

164

You can't! You can't!

165
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,420
And this.

166

168
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,916
Four silver dollars in total when sold.

169
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,636
Sold.

170
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,020
I don't regret doing this.

171
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,356
Short sleeves with missing lapels, few buttons and no buttons,

That's a trendy way of putting it.

There are rules everywhere in China.

313
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,156

we can walk

318
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,316
but before that happens, you have to say one word to us.

319

Don't do this.

342
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,916
Not leaving, are you?

343
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,900
I'll do it.

344
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,556
Sister!

345
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,716
What are you doing? You want to go insane?

346
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,836
I didn't ask for trouble.

347
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,636
The students are watching

348
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,356
while I reasoned with her.

349
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,116
I'm not being a jerk.

350
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,476
Put the magazines down.

351
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,756
You're a stubborn person.

352
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,796
There's no reasoning with you!

353
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,836
Why do you have no sense at all?

354
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,036
Sister, don't take our things!

355
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,396
Have a good talk!

356
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,380
You give me back the magazine!

357
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,756
Sister!

358
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,180
Make way!

359
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,956
Brother, let's sell it somewhere else.

360
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,636
Don't sell it here.

361

Alright.

362
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,580

366

I'll set up a stall here

367
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,196
to sell "New Youth" magazines.

368
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,836
What?

369

I want a stall here selling magazines,

370
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,396
is it a concern for you?

371
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,756
Selling books.

372
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,796
What book?

373
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,316
"New Youth"

374
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,516
Sell it, sell it.

375
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,580
Thank you!

376
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,436
To love or not to love.

377
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,796
It's not easy to watch them.

378
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,076
They are the ones who work and study.

379
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,756
Let's all disperse and get on with it.

Let me ask you something.

419
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,396
Do you have

420
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,156
the newly reissued issue

421
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,076
of the magazine that published

422
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,636
Li Dazhao's "Youth"?

423
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,236
Sure thing.

424
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:40,956
Let me have a look.

Go ahead.

426
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,036
Many people like it. They're buying the magazine

427
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,700
just for that article.

428
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,396
Yes. That's the one.

429
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,916
The Master had me looking for it for several days.

430
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,876
Finally found it.

431
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,396
I'll buy two issues.

432
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,516
Two?

433
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,156
How much?

434
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:54,716
Here you go.

435

Forty-four cents all together.

Twenty-two cents each.

Alright.

This one is new. Take it.

439

Here.

440
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,916
No problem. It's ok if you don't buy it.

441
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,500
You can read it first.

442
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,756
You can't stop here. Move along.

443
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,276
Right away.

444
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,900
Mister, we have to go.

445
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,676
Coming!

446
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,316

I've got a few too.

And let's not go to third-rate lodgings.

Master Zhang, to tell you the truth,

468
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,156
right now, Gui Jin Luan

469

Which Master Hu?

473
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,540
The Master Hu from Peking University, Hu Jun.

474

That's right.

He got a professorship due to his relative Duan Qirui.

479

Taking money and not teaching properly.

Spending all day eating, drinking, and gambling,

his reputation stinks to high heaven.

482

Since he's been here for a few days,

483

then ask him to take a break.

Let's give him a hand.

Besides, as a teacher,

486
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,820
he ought to defer to students.

487
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,796

00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,100
See if anyone comes to claim it.

514
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,260
Clean up.

515
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,676
Not going home?

516
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,476
We'll be going right away.

517
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,996
It's getting dark.

518
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,516
Should get going.

519
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:19,836
Take care.

520
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,140
See you tomorrow.

521
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,380
Friends, friends.

522
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,996
Have a drink. No, no.

523
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,156
Why not?

524
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,820
Just sit there, then.

525
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,300
Brother.

526
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,636
Hungry.

527
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,356
Bear with it.

528
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,796
What if I'm still hungry?

529
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,916
Are you hungry?

530
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,900
I...

531
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,820
I'm also hungry.

532
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,476
Then how do you bear your hunger?

533
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,700
With all my might.

534
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:24,300
Little mister.

535
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,276
Aren't you the uncle who bought that magazine.

536
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,716
Yes, yes.

537
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,076
Little misters, have you seen my purse?

538
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,060
First of all, calm down.

539
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,716
What does your purse look like?

540
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,836
It's brown.

541
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,876
And filled with the Master's silver certificates.

542
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,860
You can stop looking.

543
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,756
Is this your purse?

544
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,716
That's exactly it.

545
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,836
I can't just give it to you.

546
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,676
I have to ask you a few questions.

547
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,516
Sure, as you should.

548
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,796
Go ahead and ask.

549
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,996
What do you have

550
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,796
inside this purse?

551
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,076
Six silver certificates.

552
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,996
Five hundred and eighty-three silver dollars all together.

553
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,996
It's a divident from the soap factory.

554
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,796
Only silver certificates?

555
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,076
Are there any silver coins?

556
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,836
Only certificates, no coins.

557
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,916
Is there anything else besides that?

558
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,036
There is also a bill

559
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,556
with my name on it.

560
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,100
My name is Song Ah Di.

561
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,420
What you've said all matches up. You can count it.

562
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,116
It's all here.

563
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,796
Thank heavens.

564
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,740
My master's money has finally been found.

565
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,516
Thank you both.

566
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,100
Mister,

567
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,956
you don't need to be like this.

568
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,476
Thank you both young gentlemen.

569
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,196
You've really saved this old man's life.

570
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,396
I had thought that

571
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,156
if I couldn't find this money

572
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,996
I'd have to jump in the Huangpu river.

573
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,556
Don't be like this.

574
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,996
It's good enough that you got it back.

575
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,436
You're welcome.

576
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,636
Why don't you put it away,

577
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,540
and get back home quickly.

578
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,836
Young gentlemen,

579
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,756
please go with me to see my master.

580
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,276
He will definitely reward you.

581
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,076
No, no.

582
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,836
It's nothing. There's no need for a reward.

583
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,036
You should go back home.

584
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,316
We have to go back to the school.

585
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,916
But, but.

586
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,476
Young gentlemen,

587
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,916
let's see this to the end.

588
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,236
Look, it's already dark.

589
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,796
It's not safe for an old man

590
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,236
to be carrying so much money.

591
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,260
Would you two please escort me home?

592
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,500
Brother, let's see the uncle home.

593
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,900
Let's go.

594
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,116
Don't worry. Let me give you a hand.

595
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,540
This way.

596
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,756
Young gentlemen, you really are good people.

597
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,260
{\an8}[Lu Wanliu residence, Shanghai]

598
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,556
This way, gentlemen.

599
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,500
We're almost there.

600
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,316
Uncle Song.

601
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:40,956
Let us help.

602
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,436
No need.

603
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:41,916
Uncle Song.

604
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,236
You've got your own work.

605
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,980
Here.

606
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,596
We're here.

607
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,036
Please come in.

608
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,860
Here, young gentlemen.

609
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,796
Please.

610
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,476
Right this way.

611
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,276
Uncle, now that the money has been safely delivered,

612
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,716
we should be on our way.

613
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,916
Not at all.

614
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,276
Now that you're already here,

615
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,916
I would like to ask you two to help me testify.

616
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,156
Without you present, I can't explain it properly.

617
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,996
Master will say I'm lying.

618
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,796
Alright.

619
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,356
Here, put it down.

620
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,420
You put it down too.

621
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,756
Here, take a seat.

622
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,956
A seat here. Alright.

623
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,796
Bring out the coffee.

624
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,476
Young gentlemen, please wait.

625
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,396
I will find the Master.

626
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,140
Please, sit.

627
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,060
Master!

628
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,980
Please, the coffee.

629
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,860
Thank you.

630
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,916
I'm hungry.

631
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,900
Bear it.

632
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,700
I know.

633
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,820
Why are you two here?

634
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,916
Why are you here?

635
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,596
What do you mean, why?

636
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,796
This is my home.

637
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,716
What are you two doing here?

638
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,156
This is your home?

639
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,076
Mother, these are the two scoundrels from today

640
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,980
I was telling you about.

641
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,636
Who's the scoundrel?

642
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,076
Can't you tell the truth for once?

643
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,916
Who spilled the water all over us today?

644
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,396
I did spill the water. Didn't I give you money?

645
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,756
Is that the way to give us money?

646
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,796
Then how should I have done it?

647
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,476
Fellow student, you have still not understood

648
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,316
how you are wrong, have you?

649
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,596
Who has wronged whom?

650
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,380
Setting up stalls without permission is in violation of school rules.

651
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,676
You've brought your wares here.

652
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,076
Were you going to set up a street stall in my home?

653
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,060
Set it up then.

654
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,276
Child, don't speak this way.

655
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,180
This way, Master.

656
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:41,036
Master, these are the two young gentlemen.

657
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,476
This is our Master.

658
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,316
How do you do?

659
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,556
How should address the two of you?

660
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,396
I am Chen Qiaonian.

661
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,980
Chen Yannian.

662
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,916
Thank you both.

663
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,116
Thank you. You're welcome.

664
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,956
Dad, why are you thanking them?

665
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,916
These are the two

666
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,756
who were arguing with me at school.

667
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,756
They were setting up a stall to sell things.

668
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,196
I kicked them out.

669
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,956
Sister, didn't we already explain to you

670
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,356
that our stall is a work-study program.

671
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,876
You've already violated the school rules.

672
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,556
What work can you do? What student can you be?

673
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,836
Liu Mei!

674
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,276
These are our guests!

675
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,516
How can you speak to guests in such a way?

676
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,500
How rude!

677
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,980
Please have a seat.

678
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,156
Alright.

679
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,300
Sit, sit!

680
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,396
Old Song has told me everything.

681
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,316
The two of you, by not pocketing the money,

682
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,476
have really helped our family.

683
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,180
I must thank you properly.

684
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,916
Old Song.

685
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,740
Master.

686
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,236
This small gift is a token of my regard.

687
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,116
Please take it.

688
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,956
We can't take the money.

689
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,476
We did what we ought to do.

690
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,236
If we really wanted money,

691
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,156
couldn't we have gotten more with the five hundred?

692
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,716
Now that the money has been safely returned,

693
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,860
we are going to go now.

694
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,796
Uncle, we will take our leave.

695
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,860
Wait, don't go.

696
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,156
The both of you,

697
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,220
stay, stay.

698
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,716
I've heard you say

699
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,036
that you are doing a work-study program.

700
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,676
Then you must have some financial difficulties.

701
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,996
If you insist on refusing this money,

702
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,276
why don't we do this. I am the administrator at the school.

703
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,036
I can waive all of your

704
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,620
tuition and miscellaneous fees.

705
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,356
It's a matter of course to pay for tuition if attending school.

706
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,876
We pay what should be paid.

707
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,636
We'll figure it out ourselves.

708
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,076
Thank you for your kindness.

709
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,300
We will take our leave.

710
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,300
Wen Yao!

711
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:49,460
Wen Yao, is there anything to eat?

712
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,276
I'm starving.

713
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,956
Yannian, Qiaonian?

714
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,916
Uncle Wu?

715
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,116
What are you doing here?

716
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,900
Old Wu, do you know these two?

717
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,196
Far more than know!

718
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,276
These two are Chen Duxiu's sons.

719
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,036
Chen Yannian. Chen Qiaonian.

720
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,916
So they are Chen Duxiu's young masters!

721
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,076
No wonder.

722
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,196
Uncle,

723
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,876
he is his own person, and we are us.

724
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,876
We don't have anything to do with him.

725
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,316
We're going back to school now.

726
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,236
Any later and the school gate will be closed.

727
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,300
Farewell.

728
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,100
Yes, alright.

729
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,756
Take care, young gentlemen.

730
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,996
What? Just leaving like this?

731
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,116
But, these two guys...

732
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,180
How did they end up here with you?

733
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,036
Elder Wu, have a seat.

734
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,156
Alright, alright.

735
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,460
Get the cooks started on a meal.

736
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,140
{\an8}[Daheituo Village, Laoting, Hebei]

737
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,780
{\an8}[Li Baohua, son of Li Dazhao]

738
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,756
{\an8}[Li Xinghua, daughter of Li Dazhao]

739
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,740
Xinghua.

740
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,940
Who are you?

741
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,876
You're acting like a real man now.

742
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,196
Mom!

743
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,316
What is it?

744
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,596
The weasels came again?

745
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,796
Grab a stick to drive them away!

746
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,076
Don't let them bite your younger sister again!

747
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,365
It's not weasels!

748
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:51,116
It's not weasels, then what is it?

749
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,586
A silly lump.

750
00:31:55,588 --> 00:31:56,703
{\an8}[Zhao Renlan, wife of Li Dazhao]

751
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,501
Miss. The silly lump has come back.

752
00:32:04,043 --> 00:32:06,414
Came back...

753
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,436
I thought you would only be able to come back at night.

754
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,596
When I look at it, there is nothing wrong.

755
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,756
I changed my to ticket to an early morning one.

756
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,316
Rented a donkey cart. Getting on there's also no people.

757
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,236
In no time, I was pulled to our house entrance.

758
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,300
Fast.

759
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,436
The fire... firewood pile.

760
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,116
Those siberian weasels have been coming to the firewood pile.

761
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,116
Xinghua, Xinghua's been bitten by them.

762
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,556
Her, her brother grabs a stick

763
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,756
driving away and hurrying over there

764
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,820
to find weasels

765
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,676
Hurry, come here!

766
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,556
This is your guys' dad!

767
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,556
Don't you guys shout to want to find your dad all the time?

768
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,556
Hurry over, call for "dad".

769
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,516
Dad's back.

770
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,918
Dad's come back. Quickly.

771
00:32:40,942 --> 00:32:42,176
Quickly.

772
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,286
Hurry to the front. Quickly go and call dad.

773
00:32:44,287 --> 00:32:46,286
Hurry, go!

774
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,740
Xinghua.

775
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,556
Dad!

776
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,419
You...

777
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:07,139
This child, all day who do you keep shouting at?

778
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:07,916
Want you dad, want your dad. Go search.

779
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,796
Dad's come, and you...

780
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,476
You stay in your den.

781
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,236
You quickly!

782
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,116
Stop being stubborn there.

783
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,196
You, quickly go.

784
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,260
Li Baohua

785
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,660
Are you still wetting your bed right now?

786
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,876
Xinghua, Xinghua, Xinghua!

787
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,596
Enough now, enough now.

788
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,796
Come down, come down.

789
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,396
Don't let your dad hold you.

790
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,780
Dad's tired. Quickly.

791
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,156
Wash your face, wash your face.

792
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,476
Dad's washing his face, is that okay?

793
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,196
Dad's going to wash his hands.

794
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,516
Then I'll hold you again, is that okay?

795
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,580
Good.

796
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,676
Xinghua, catch a big chaffinch.

797
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,476
Slaughter chicken!

798
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,500
Tonight we're eating chicken!

799
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,020
Slaughter chicken!

800
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:17,020
Our... our family can finally eat a reunion meal.

801
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,756
Student Li Baohua.

802
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,860
Come out and catch chicken.

803
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,116
Stop it over there!

804
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,476
Let me help, miss.

805
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,380
No problem.

806
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,436
Dad, what is this?

807
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,220
This is called Junqi (land battle chess).

808
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,916
Dad, why didn't buy me something good to eat?

809
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,580
Didn't you eat all the big reed flowers, you still want to eat something good?

810
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,476
How much good food are you able to eat?

811
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,516
But this land battle chess, we can play with it for a long time.

812
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,876
Do you guys know?

813
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,476
When dad was in Japan,

814
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,796
everyone relied on this to relieve boredom.

815
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:58,156
Baohua, don't think that this land battle chess doesn't look good.

816
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,356
This is what dad personally made for you.

817
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,462
Dad will teach you, okay?

818
00:35:02,462 --> 00:35:04,182
Okay

819
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,156
This Junqi

820
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,316
needs to have two people to battle.

821
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,676
What's a victory?

822
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,876
I take this piece,

823
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,116
occupy your military command center.

824
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,156
This is a victory.

825
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,316
You see these pieces on the chessboard,

826
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,876
The biggest piece within these pieces is this one.

827
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,820
General.

828
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,716
The last one is this one, landmine.

829
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,636
Landmine, excluding the military engineer,

830
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,316
is afraid of no one.

831
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,100
Xinghua.

832
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:31,916
It's burning hot.

833
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,796
Do you understand?

834
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,156
Understand.

835
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:34,556
Come.

836
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,676
I'll teach you how to move.

837
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,276
Dad, drink water.

838
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,980
Thank you, Xinghua!

839
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,180
Dad, what is the biggest move?

840
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,076
Just now, didn't dad tell you?

841
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,676
General.

842
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,676
Dad. Then when can you become the biggest official?

843
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,916
Like this, then we can eat meat every day.

844
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,516
Who said dad wanted to be an official?

845
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,116
Didn't the village people all say？

846
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,956
Studying is so you can become a big official.

847
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,796
Dad, aren't you this village's

848
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,156
person who reads the most.

849
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,836
For sure, you can be the biggest official.

850
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,996
Dad, after you become a big official,

851
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,436
won't we have money then.

852
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,156
When the time comes, can you buy me fruit candy to eat.

853
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,676
Second girl let me have a lick,

854
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,980
it was especially good.

855
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,676
Come.

856
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,796
Saying it like this,

857
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,356
you guys all want dad to become an official.

858
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,876
Being an official is incredible!

859
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,956
And there's money!

860
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,180
Is being an official is incredible?

861
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,756
Baohua, just now dad taught you land battle chess.

862
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,836
Who do you think is the most incredible in here?

863
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,796
General.

864
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,996
Not right.

865
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,516
General is afraid of the landmine.

866
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,476
Right.

867
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,156
Then, the landmine is the most incredible.

868
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,156
Then who is the landmine afraid of?

869
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,476
The landmine is afraid of the military engineer.

870
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,436
Oh right!

871
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,740
Then military engineer is the most incredible.

872
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,036
That's not right.

873
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,396
After the military engineer removes the landmine,

874
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,396
it will die with whoever it meets!

875
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,516
What you said is correct.

876
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,036
The military engineer acting alone

877
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,156
is surely the weakest.

878
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,596
But the military engineer

879
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,556
can make a lot of incredible weapons.

880
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,996
You guys think about it.

881
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,076
A pile of military engineers stacked together

882
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,076
can create many, many different kinds

883
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,076
of weapons in one piece.

884
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,740
Then officials, aren't they afraid of them?

885
00:37:07,714 --> 00:37:09,714
Afraid.

886
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,476
So although second girl's father is a small town official

887
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,076
but her when her mom and grandmother

888
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,620
grabs a broom, he will run.

889
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:22,876
Therefore, later dad will become a military engineer.

890
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,556
Xinghua, Baohua.

891
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,876
After you guys grow up

892
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,316
No matter if you become a military engineer or something else.

893
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,396
It is up to you to decide.

894
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,236
But remember,

895
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,556
no matter what we become,

896
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:40,540
we need to be a strong and disciplined person.

897
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,636
We need to be

898
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,596
a person who never harms ordinary people.

899
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,356
This is a present Dad gives to you.

900
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,396
Thank you, Dad!

901
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,020
What thank you? Take a look.

902
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,756
Such a beautiful case.

903
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,996
Case is very beautiful

904
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,716
Recently, a friend

905
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,196
made me go to Nanjing to be an official.

906
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,956
It is said that it's a lucrative job.

907
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,476
Income is also pretty high.

908
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,076
But I declined it.

909
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,860
I said the warlords right now

910
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,316
cause damage to the country and suffering to the people,

911
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,876
having the ordinary people deal with their days so bitterly.

912
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,876
When I was returning back from Japan,

913
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,316
I made a malicious oath.

914
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,476
Even if I die,

915
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,660
I will never follow their bad example.

916
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,356
You won't blame me right?

917
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,980
I listen to you.

918
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,356
I know you won't do things that will cause harm to the ordinary people.

919
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,636
We can't let other people stab us in the back, right?

920
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,716
Do what you want to do.

921
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,276
Us three mother and children you... You don't need to worry.

922
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,916
In the countryside, we can get through anything.

923
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,996
Then... when you become an official,

924
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,676
what plans do you have?

925
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,716
I plan to go back to Beijing and continue running my magazine.

926
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,756
Although, I say it doesn't earn as much as an official,

927
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,476
But in any case, our food and clothing, we don't need to worry about.

928
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,036
Moreover, that is what I have always wanted to do.

929
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,556
You go steadily do it.

930
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,436
I'll keep watch of this house.

931
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,916
It's just that this work

932
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,700
may have dangers.

933
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,980
Running a magazine, isn't it just dealing with some cultural things?

934
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,180
How can there still be danger?

935
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,156
You know my ambitions...

936
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,476
is for sure not only running a magazine.

937
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,396
I know that you are a person who wants to do big things.

938
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,396
Doing the right things.

939
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,020
You dealing with those cultural thing.

940
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,300
I also can't make sense of what the meaning is.

941
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,556
I am afraid that it will give you an impediment.

942
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,316
How can it?

943
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,756
With you behind my back,

944
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,060
I won't mention much steadiness.

945
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,596
Beijing is cold in winter,

946
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,516
Take this hand stove

947
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,796
to warm up.

948
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,356
I made a case for you

949
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,860
Look.

950
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,436
Tie it up this way, and it's nice and warm

951
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,100
and you won't burn your hand.

952
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,540
It's suitable.

953
00:40:10,029 --> 00:40:12,714
{\an8}[Shanghai]

954
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,476
I bang on the small gong.

955
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,036
Peking University is really nonsense.

956
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,836
Quarrelling from jealousy, hitting each other.

957
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,316
Forced to send Cai Yuanpei

958
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,620
to take over Peking University Hall.

959
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,236
The cultured sweep the floor.

960
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,476
A great country's highest educational institute

961
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,156
has unexpectedly raised such a group of scum.

962
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,996
This country, what hopes does it still have?

963
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,676
Right.

964
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,516
This group of students went as far as to quarrel from jealousy,

965
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,316
striking violently.

966
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,516
What is this? Right!

967
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,140
Exactly.

968
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,047
Too overboard! Exactly!

969
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:54,444
{\an8}[Beijing]

970
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,156
I... come to you for advice.

971
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,876
Tell me, what do you think Li Yuanhong is doing?

972
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,196
He gave three gold medals

973
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:01,060
to make me hurry to Beijing to take position as Peking University's headmaster.

974
00:40:57,881 --> 00:41:01,276
{\an8}[Cai Yuanpei, styled Jie Min]

975
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,116
What is the reason?

976
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,956
This President Li Yuanhong

977
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,900
was unbearably mocked by Duan Qirui.

978
00:41:05,182 --> 00:41:07,756
{\an8}[Wang Daxie, styled Bo Tang, diplomat of the Beiyang government]

979
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,076
He wanted to do something practical to court favors

980
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,916
to compete with Duan Qirui.

981
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,636
Fighting doesn't work here, so his communication

982
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,276
coincided with a scandal at Peking University.

983
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,476
This President Li

984
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,516
took the opportunity to remove Duan Qirui's trusted aide,

985
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,596
Hu Renyuan's, position of headmaster.

986
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,796
Your disciple Fan Yuanlin recommended you,

987
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,900
naturally to obtain popular support.

988
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,676
I know.

989
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,276
The current Peking University,

990
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,820
we can say that it is already rotten to the core.

991
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,716
I just don't want to wade in these muddy waters.

992
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,476
Jiemin says one thing but means another.

993
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,396
Your people are already all in Beijing.

994
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,260
Didn't you just indicate your attitude?

995
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,036
Brother Bo Tang, you know me well.

996
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,956
Frankly saying.

997
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,636
Before going up north,

998
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,276
I specially paid a visit to Mr. Sun Zhongshan.

999
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,756
Mr. Sun said to me that

1000
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:06,140
he hopes that I can turn around Peking University's atmosphere

1001
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,276
and establish a top ranking school that can rise in the world.

1002
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,036
He also hopes that I

1003
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,700
cultivate the banner of China's modern education

1004
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:22,636
and hope that I can soon educate people for the country.

1005
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,996
It's true. Education saves the nation, science saves the nation.

1006
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,220
Talent saves the nation.

1007
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:32,300
This is exactly the ideal I, Cai Yuanpei, pursue.

1008
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,116
Currently, China has many things waiting to be done.

1009
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,716
Starting first with the atmosphere,

1010
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,196
nothing can surpass the rise of Chen Duxiu's

1011
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,796
New Culture Movement.

1012
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,076
The most appealing

1013
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,716
also can't surpass the high rise of Chen Duxiu's

1014
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:47,356
banners of both democracy and science.

1015
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,276
Spreading democracy and science.

1016
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,900
The root is in education.

1017
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,596
You, Cai Yuanpei.

1018
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:57,276
If we can use the treasure of Peking University to reform and innovate

1019
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,356
to revive our Chinese nation,

1020
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,220
we will then have a support and hope.

1021
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,996
Brother Bo Tang's words

1022
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,980
is exactly the aspiration of I, Cai Yuanpei.
