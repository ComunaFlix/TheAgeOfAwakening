Go, go, go!

What are you doing?

49
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,960
What are you doing out in the rain?

50
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,160
Tasting the Jiangnan rain.

Were you that stupid in Japan?

Look at the rain on you!

There's raindrops all over!

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,320
What's a drop of rain?

56
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,256
When I was in Japan,

57
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,480
I was covered in lice.

58
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,256
Once.

59
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,096
Then Zhang Shizhao asked me to edit an issue.

60
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,056
I locked myself in my room,

61
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,976
I didn't leave the house for half a month.

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,616
Then the article was finished.

63
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,816
I went out,

64
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,096
Yi Baisha looked at me and said:

65
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,336
What are those spots on your body?

66
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,536
I looked down and it was all...

67
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,040
Don't say, don't say, don't say.

68
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,136
Mr Chen.

69
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,240
You've suffered.

70
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:53,803
Come. Sit.

71
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,160
Sit with me and listen to the rain for a while.

72
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,976
There is no revolution without suffering,

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,496
but I brought this misery upon myself.

74
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,856
I like to... I like to enjoy it.

75
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,536
It's just that... I got you into trouble.

76
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,376
You're a talented student from Beijing Normal University,

77
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,720
suffering with me.

78
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,720
I'm sorry.

79
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,936
As long as the family can be together,

80
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,376
whatever the suffering and hardship,

81
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
I'm not afraid.

82
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,016
It's just that Yannian and Qiaonian don't want to go home.

83
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,480
I don't feel well.

85
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,416
Why don't you go and get the two children tomorrow

86
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,336
and bring them home?

87
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,816
Don't let them roam around outside.

88
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,280
I'm not going to pick them up.

89
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,040
These two boys have a lot of backbone.

90
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,960
It's good to go out and make your own living.

91
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,496
Yannian and Qiaonian

92
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,176
are two good boys with big ambitions.

93
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,216
After the May 9th National Disgrace,

94
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,936
they both came to Shanghai to study.

95
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,656
Seeing our family's difficulties,

96
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,736
they had brought from the countryside

97
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,256
100 silver yuan for tuition

98
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,696
and gave it to me.

99
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,696
They went out to work on their own.

100
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,736
I tried to give it back to them

101
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,376
but they wouldn't listen.

102
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,000
You said Shanghai docks are so rough.

103
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,080
What would happen if something happened to them?

104
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,440
Zhong Fu.

105
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,016
I'm begging you.

106
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,560
You go and bring them both home.

107

Junman.

108
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,160
When I was abroad,

109
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,696
I heard a song from Europe

110
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,616
called "The Internationale".

111
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,896
Although the lyrics have not been translated into Chinese,

112
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,376
there are a few lines in it

113
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,416
I was very impressed by.

114
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,696
The idea is

115
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,160
there is no saviour

116
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,080
or there is no fairy god.

117
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,680
To create happiness for all

118
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,440
is up to us.

119
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,296
Well sung... well said.

120
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,520
From large countries to small individuals,

121
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,741
one should forge their own destiny.

122
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:10,656
Trusting your life

123
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,496
to your father and family.

124
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,176
You can't rely on that.

125
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,336
So, what is the job of the father?

126
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,237
Where has your duty as a father gone?

127
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:21,216
It is my duty

128
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,296
to let them know

129
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,216
how to be live up to

130
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,160
the social and historical responsibilities of this country.

131
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,976
In these troubled times,

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,696
to be a son of I, Chen Duxiu,

133
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,616
one must first work hard on one's heart and soul.

134
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,656
Starve the body and the skin, but not the soul.

135
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,976
Act in accordance with the law,

136
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,696
so your heart is willing

137
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,576
to endure what it once could not.

138
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,576
You are a thinker against the ways of Confucius and Mencius.

139
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,176
Why did you make a statement

140
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,496
out of Mencius' quotes?

141
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,816
Yuan Shikai wants to make Confucianism the state religion,

142
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,376
of course I want to oppose it.

143
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,976
But make no mistake,

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,976
I am against

145
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,976
the three principles of Confucianism that are poisoning the people.

146

Neither Confucius nor Mencius.

147
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,000
All right, all right, I can't talk you out of it.

148

00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:05,716
Zhong Fu.

173
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,240
Yongcheng.

174
00:10:07,463 --> 00:10:09,800
{\an8}[Zou Yongcheng, styled Qi Zhi]

175
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,096
Since we left the boat, I've missed you.

176
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,960
Greetings, gentlemen.

177
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,976
Come on, you're barging in.

178
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,816
Go and meet us at the front!

179
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,176
No, I'm not going to meet him.

180
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,736
Why is this child so stubborn?

181
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,176
You tell me, he's still your old man,

182
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,336
then the bones are still attached to the tendons.

183
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,016
Where did all the hate come from?

184
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,136
I don't have a grudge against him,

185
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,776
but I just don't go to see him.

186
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,816
Same temper as your father.

187
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,376
I'm sure of it.

188
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,160
I can't get it back with nine oxen.

189
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,536
The fire is good.

190
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,056
Why are you, Wang Menzou,

191
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,016
so stingy?

192
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,376
I'm invited to dinner,

193
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,336
not at a restaurant, but at a home.

194
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,240
How much money do you save?

195
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,416
He said it! I do save money.

196
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,576
What would you like to eat?

197
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,176
I prepared it all yesterday.

198
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,376
The cook was also taken from Zishou's house.

199
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,536
I didn't spend any mony on this.

200
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,856
I can attest.

201
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,016
What Menzou said is true in every sense of the word.

202
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,136
{\an8}[Chen Zishou, owner of Qunyi Book Club]
Our family cook

203
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,160
{\an8}[Chen Zishou, owner of Qunyi Book Club]
was dragged here by him.

204
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,376
Zhong Fu, I'm borrowing the cook's skills.

205
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,136
You should also write us a couple of words.

206
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,336
To each his own.

207
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,256
He gave me a reception

208
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,456
by borrowing the cook from you.

209
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,696
He should be grateful to you.

210
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,560
What's it to do with me?

211
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,136
Me!

212
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,096
Zhong Fu, who is the stingy one?

213
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,776
Of course, he's stingy one!

214
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,936
And the famous Yadong Library

215
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,816
has always been housed in this alley.

216
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,296
I've tried so many times to get him to move out

217
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,336
but he won't listen!

218
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,176
It's easy to move out!

219
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,096
Wang Mengzou, I tell you,

220
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,416
we are doing great things with a bang.

221
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,296
If you want to die,

222
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,616
just cower in the alleyway.

223
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,656
If you want to live,

224
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,776
you have to move out of the alleyway

225
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,456
and onto the main road.

226
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,336
All right, all right.

227
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,696
You're standing around talking,

228
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,096
then sit down and talk.

229
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,720
Everyone sit down.

230
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:46,053
Sit down, sit down.

231
00:11:46,077 --> 00:11:46,724
{\an8}[Chen Qiaonian, second son of Chen Duxiu]
Qiaonian.

232
00:11:46,724 --> 00:11:47,199
{\an8}[Chen Qiaonian, second son of Chen Duxiu]

233
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,896
{\an8}[Chen Qiaonian, second son of Chen Duxiu]
You're too young to hold a grudge.

234
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,936
This is a lotus leaf and yellow beef feet dish.

235
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,696
Serve it to your father.

236
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,816
Meet him.

237
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,656
Give him a surprise.

238
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,056
OK, I'll send him up later

239
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,216
and surprise him.

240
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,200
{\an8}[Chen Yannian, eldest son of Chen Duxiu]
That's right!

241
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,016
{\an8}[Chen Yannian, eldest son of Chen Duxiu]

242
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,576
Today, everyone invited to

243
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,416
firstly

244
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,616
celebrate Zhong Fu's return to the country.

245
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,896
That's the second.

246
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,456
Since the failure of the Second Revolution,

247
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,416
We revolutionaries

248
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,616
have been scattered to the winds.

249
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,456
We went our separate ways and hid into hiding.

250
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,656
Some died, some were wounded.

251
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,256
Today, having us all here together

252
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,016
after the disaster

253
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,576
is not easy.

254
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,336
The situation now

255
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,536
is that European powers are at war.

256
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,136
Originally it was our country's

257
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,816
time to take a break.

258
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,776
But what about the Japanese?

259
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,454
They took advantage of the situation,

260
00:12:38,478 --> 00:12:39,160
by proposing

261
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,296
the Twenty-One Demands of powers in Shandong.

262
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,376
That Yuan Shikai,

263
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,896
betrayed the country with the National Humiliation of May 9th.

264
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,600
A disgrace. It is truly a disgrace.

265
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,543
{\an8}[Chen Zipei, Owner of Qunyi Book Club]

266
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,416
And now the entire country is seething,

267
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,936
protesting.

268
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,336
At this time, what should we do?

269
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,576
Observe with a critical eye?

270
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,976
Be docile subjects? Be a conquered people?

271
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,216
Never.

272
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,496
Now is the time for us to fan the flames

273
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,176
add fuel to the fire.

274
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,416
So please let us confide in each other,

275
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,816
what thoughts we have,

276
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,920
and all express our own views.

277
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,896
Yongcheng is a military man.

278
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,798
But I think the most important thing in China today

279
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:17,936
is to first defeat Yuan Shikai,

280
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,136
then create a republic.

281
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,736
Mengzou is right.

282
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,736
The Western European powers fighting amongst themselves

283
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,296
have no time to attend to us.

284
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,296
But Yuan Shikai

285
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,176
has no time to encircle and suppress the KMT.

286
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,936
We need to use this opportunity

287
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,056
to mobilize the masses

288
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,576
forment anti-Yuan Shikai public opinion

289
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,416
and actively prepare for hostilities against him.

290
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,696
When the time is right

291
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,056
we will rise in rebellion

292
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,736
defeat Yuan Shikai in one fell swoop

293
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,136
and create a new republic.

294
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,616
General Zou said it well.

295
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,336
I was also inspired by Brother Zhong Fu.

296
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,976
This time

297
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,416
prepare to organize Hunan personnel in Shanghai

298
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,696
set up a national salvation newspaper

299
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,536
and mobilize anti-Yuan Shikai sentiments.

300
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,536
By the way, all esteemed persons present

301
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,296
please give us your advice

302
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,736
and lend your guidance.

303
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,936
For a general to organize a newspaper commends admiration.

304
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,616
My brothers have been long involved in publishing.

305
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,496
In the future

306
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,416
if you have any use for us

307
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,536
we are yours to command.

308
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,616
We will do our best to help.

309
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,056
Mr Zhang Shizhao has already decided

310
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,296
to return to China from Japan.

311
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,736
I, Mr. Zhang and Zhong Fu

312
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,536
as well as the magazine "The Tiger" we operated

313
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,816
will also return to Shanghai from Japan.

314
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,736
Now that this Hunan-Anhui alliance has been settled

315
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,656
I believe that

316
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,376
with the leadership of

317
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,256
Mr. Zhang and Zhong Fu

318
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,976
we will definitely

319
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,760
make the newspaper a booming success.

320
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,016
Zhong Fu, don't just eat peanuts!

321
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,296
We have been waiting and waiting

322
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,256
for you to finally come back.

323
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,056
Everyone wants to hear if you have any opinions

324
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,256
or new thoughts.

325
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:44,936
Say something.

326
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,656
Yes.

327
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,736
Right, Zhong Fu.

328
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,376
The thirteenth year of Emperor Tongzhi's reign,

329
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,616
in a discussion about naval defense, Li Hongzhang

330
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,056
termed our China to be

331
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,329
at the most critical moment in 3000 years

332
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,216
facing the greatest enemy in 3000 years.

333
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,936
I would like to ask everyone present

334
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,816
what they think this crisis and this enemy

335
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,680
refers to.

336
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,776
This... What is it?

337
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,016
Since the twelfth year of Emperor Daoguang

338
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,536
when Lin Zexu sold opium

339
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,896
and the British used gunboat diplomacy

340
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,736
to force open China

341
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,496
our country

342
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,056
has been in crisis.

343
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,416
Li Hongzhang meticulously pursued Westernization, built a navy,

344
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,896
spent decades busily self-strengthening

345
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,176
And the result?

346
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,056
The Sino-Japanese War. The country collapsed after a single fight

347
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,016
helping to achieve the aims of the Japanese empire

348
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,136
From then on

349
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,400
the Qing dynasty has existed only in name.

350
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,896
And then the Xinhai Revolution.

351
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,416
Sun Yatsen overthrew the imperial regime and founded a republic.

352
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,176
But what is a republic?

353
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,176
Mr. Sun Yatsen has also been seeking an answer.

354
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,816
Our compariots even less able to come to agreement

355
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,256
each of us with our own opinions.

356
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,656
We anti-monarchists, Republicans who have

357
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,696
gone through fire and water

358
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,616
now must return to being docile subjects of an emperor.

359
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,536
Is history playing a joke on us?

360
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,296
So today I just want to ask

361
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,368
This most critical moment in 3000 years

362
00:16:04,392 --> 00:16:07,392
This greatest enemy in 3000 years

363
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,856
What does it really refer to?

364
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,176
Mr. Chen's words are just so insightful.

365
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,096
Hit the nail on the head with a single sentence.

366
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,720
That's right.

367
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,096
What insight?

368
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,136
It's just banal truisms.

369
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,776
I think his glib and exaggerated ways

370
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,696
is just the same as before.

371
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,016
He only boasts and causes trouble

372
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,976
without taking any responsibility.

373
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,136
As I see it

374
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,496
the crisis is the collapse of the imperial regime

375
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,616
the powerful enemy refers to the Western Powers, right?

376
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,416
Crises - China has experienced many.

377
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,936
From Qin Shihuang to Puyi

378
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,816
There has been tens of dynastic changes

379
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,776
But in the end it's still

380
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,736
exchanging one autocracy for another.

381
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,056
China has also faced many strong enemies

382
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,696
Since ancient times

383
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,057
how many enemies have battled to the Central Plains?

384
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:51,976
And the result?

385
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,536
Not only did our China not wither away

386
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,240
but like a rolling snowball grow bigger and bigger.

387
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,776
5000 years of Chinese Civilization

388
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,696
That is the advantage left to us by our ancestors.

389
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,736
So we have the self-confidence.

390
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,296
Zhongfu, what you've spoken of is history.

391
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,136
Now is no longer the past.

392
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,800
Exactly.

393
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,520
The Opium War broke this pattern.

394
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,296
This time it is really different.

395
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,496
This time we are facing

396
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,376
a truly unprecedented enemy.

397
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,496
This great enemy

398
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,216
is not only militarily strong

399
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,176
but more importantly, strong

400
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,816
in terms of ideology and theory.

401
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,776
Not only do they have

402
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,976
advanced weaponry as a result of industrial production

403
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,776
They also have advanced ideological systems

404
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,536
as a result of capitalism.

405
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,816
Compared to them

406
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,641
our system is backwards.

407
00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:45,374
Our thoughts are also backwards.

408
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:49,016
In short, our people are backwards.

409
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,616
For our great Chinese civilization,

410
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,378
in thousands of years, this is the first time.

411
00:17:53,402 --> 00:17:54,955
Right?

412
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,296
Therefore our conclusion is

413
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,657
in order to transform China,

414
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:02,176
we must first transform the minds of Chinese people

415
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,016
Improve the Suzhi of Chinese people

416
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,696
In order to recover China's former splendour

417
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,896
the most urgent need is

418
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,440
to bring up a new generation of people.

419
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,496
Brother Zhong Fu is right.

420
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,016
An original insight.

421
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,376
It is true that a new generation

422
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,696
is fundamental for national rejuvenation.

423
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,416
But this is too difficult.

424
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,256
It can't be accomplished overnight.

425
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,840
True. This requires a long process

426
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,496
that can't seek instant returns

427
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,016
but we also can't hesitate and dither.

428
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,536
If we have inborn talent

429
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,245
to be afraid to use it is a dereliction of duty

430
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:38,496
and leave a legacy of misfortune.

431
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,936
The likes of us cannot be

432
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,216
spectators looking on from the sidelines.

433
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,336
To be concerned, to take on the work.

434
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,736
Not be a turtle retracting its head into its shell.

435
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,576
That is our responsibility.

436
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,536
Well said, Zhong Fu.

437
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,096
What should we do?

438
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,776
First, theoretical basics.

439
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,496
Second, transformation of society.

440
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,416
Of the multitude of things

441
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,136
these two are the most important.

442
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,656
Zhong Fu,

443
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,520
there are all kinds of foreign ideologies

444
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:05,496
and all kinds of thinking.

445
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,616
Which one is suitable for our country?

446
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,440
Good question!

447
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,216
In terms advanced western ideologies and institutions,

448
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,256
we must be discriminating;

449
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,096
we must find the most key

450
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,736
the most universal, the most practical

451
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,576
to arm our youth.

452
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,776
I've been probing this question for many years

453
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,456
and have found a clear conclusion

454
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,816
which I will soon make known to the world.

455
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,216
That's why this time I've returned to China

456
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,256
to establish a magazine

457
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,056
that will serve as a rallying cry

458
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,736
for the political and ethical awakening of the nation!

459
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,256
I pledge to you all

460
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,136
that if I run the magazine for ten years

461
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,280
the whole country will change its thinking!

462
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,683
Well said! Good!

463
00:19:48,707 --> 00:19:50,176
Good.

464
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,536
Everyone.

465
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,598
Each generation has their duty.

466
00:19:53,622 --> 00:19:55,006
Our generation's duty is to

467
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,576
is to run this magazine

468
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,496
in order to identify, select and validate

469
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,136
one of the most advanced theories of contemporary thought

470
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,896
as a means of transforming China's youth

471
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,256
and transforming society

472
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,320
to explore a way to revitalise China.

473
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:17,381
Menzou, time to eat!

474
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,336
Yes, yes, yes. In the house, please. In the house, please. Come on.

475
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,776
Okay, let's eat. Let's eat.

476
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,376
In the house please, in the house.

477
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,816
Brother Zhong Fu.

478
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,016
What an enlightening experience!

479
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,456
From now on, you will be our commander-in-chief

480
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,200
and we will listen to you.

481
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,416
Serve, serve, serve.

482
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,136
Quick, Huzi, bring the tray over here.

483
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,920
Yes, ma'am.

484
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,880
Lotus leaf hooves.

485
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,576
Come, Qiaonian.

486
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,976
This one. Bring it over to your father.

487
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,016
Okay.

488
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,000
Huzi, quick.

489
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,080
Lotus leaf hooves.

490
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,000
Quick, Huzi, bring it over.

491
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,616
The first thing I propose

492
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,976
is that we drink to the wonderful opinions

493
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,136
we just exchanged with one another.

494
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,440
Come!

495
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,520
Not bad.

496
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,176
Fragrant.

497
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,216
Menzou,

498
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,496
just these few dishes?

499
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,616
Of course not.

500
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,576
The dishes have to be served one by one.

501
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,016
A good dish is worth the wait.

502
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,256
Don't you be worried.

503
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,856
The most substantial dish today

504
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,056
is a staple dish of my hometown Jixi, Anhui.

505
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,576
Lotus leaf hooves.

506
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
Great.

507
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,896
Even in Anhui-style restaurants

508
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,776
you won't see this dish

509
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,016
because the ingredients

510
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,376
are too hard to get.

511
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,256
It's from entirely purebred

512
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,120
oxen that's three and a half years old

513
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,296
A secret recipe. Wrapped in lotus leaf.

514
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,496
Tastes exquisite.

515
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,976
The best of Anhui cuisine.

516
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,496
One for each, today.

517
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,736
Everyone has a share.

518
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,856
One for each!

519
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,176
Seven people, seven hooves.

520
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,804
That's two head of oxen.

521
00:22:11,804 --> 00:22:12,456
Right.

522
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,880
That's one substantial dish.

523
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,976
What do you think, Zhong Fu? Am I stingy?

524
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Let's taste it first.

525
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,456
Come on. Lotus wrapped hooves.

526
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,400
Here it comes.

527
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,800
Quick, Qiaonian, you go first.

528
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,698
Huzi, follow.

529
00:22:32,722 --> 00:22:34,286
Great!

530
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,816
Look, here it comes.

531
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,416
Qiaonian, how is it you?

532
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,176
Let me introduce everyone.

533
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,280
This is Zhongfu's second son, Qiaonian.

534
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,816
Wow. He's grown up!

535
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,536
What a talented young man.

536
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,296
A grown up boy.

537
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,336
Qiaonian, your old man has come back.

538
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,496
Come, go see your father.

539
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,736
I'll have one first.

540
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,096
There's one for everyone.

541
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,776
Good good good.

542
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,616
One per person.

543
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,536
Come, I give to you.

544
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,576
This is a token of respect for his father.

545
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,656
Not bad, not bad, not bad.

546
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,696
Qiaonian brought it up especially for you.

547
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,056
Grab a bite!

548
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,936
A son's filial piety to his old father.

549
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,656
Come, come, come.

550
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,040
This big yellow cow's hoof.

551
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,336
What's... what's going on here?

552
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,320
I don't know!

553
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,456
Mr. Chen, don't be angry. Mrs. Chen, don't be angry.

554
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,216
It's all my fault. My fault!

555
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,720
Sister-in-law, it's not your fault.

556
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,096
Qiaonian.

557
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,960
What's going on?

558
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,656
You shouldn't be the only one who did it.

559
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,976
Where are your associates?

560
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,215
Bring him here.

561
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:54,896
Chen Yannian, come out!

562
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,696
I'm the mastermind of this.

563
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,976
Take it out on me if you're angry.

564
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,856
Yannian, how old are you?

565
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,216
Are you still a child?

566
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,216
You are an adult!

567
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,536
How could you do such a ridiculous thing?

568
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,468
Even if you have a problem with your old man,

569
00:24:15,492 --> 00:24:16,640
you can't treat him like this!

570
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,136
Do you know what you call this?

571
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,976
This is called treason!

572
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,096
This would be frowned upon in our home town!

573
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,240
Heaven condemns you!

574
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,536
Sorry, Uncle Wang, Aunt Wang.

575
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,136
I've put you in a difficult position.

576
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,296
I do this today,

577
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,616
not because of him, Chen Duxiu,

578
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,216
who didn't take enough care of my mother and us two brothers.

579
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,176
In Anqing,

580
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,776
we were not rich.

581
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,336
But at least the family has some property,

582
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,816
enough for our family to live on.

583
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,296
Since he doesn't care about us,

584
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,816
we won't beg him again.

585
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,576
We're doing this today

586
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,616
for the sake of our suffering family

587
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,536
and for

588
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,376
our cousin Chen Yongnian, who has been tortured because of him,

589
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,920
to teach him a lesson.

590
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,736
To speak of treason,

591
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,576
Chen Duxiu is the one who is really

592
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,456
a treacherous hypocrite.

593
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,416
Yannian, you're going too far!

594
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,536
Don't talk about your father like that!

595
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,496
You shut up!

596
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,936
Let him speak.

597
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,096
Alright.

598
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,976
Today, in front of all my uncles and aunts,

599
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,336
I'm going to reveal the shame of our Chen family.

600
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,136
Everyone please judge.

601
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,456
Last autumn,

602
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,456
after the failure of the Second Revolution in Anqing,

603
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,133
Chen Duxiu himself abandons his family and flees,

604
00:25:22,157 --> 00:25:23,736
knowing the danger,

605
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,216
but still left his sick grandmother

606
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,696
and our mother and son behind.

607
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,416
Ni Xichong sent his men to raid our house.

608
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,256
My sister, Yuying, sacrificed her life to block the front hall

609
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,896
covering me and Qiaonian to jump out of the window.

610
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,256
Cousin Chen Yongnian

611
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,016
who protected his younger brother Chen Zhannian

612
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,976
was arrested for pretending to be me,

613
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,896
and was tortured to death.

614
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,216
Grandfather, who died after a long illness, was still at home

615
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,240
Grandmother is bedridden.

616
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,296
The family rushed to Shanghai

617
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,616
to find Chen Duxiu,

618
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,856
asking him to return for his father's funeral.

619
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,736
But he was greedy for life and death.

620
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,576
Not only did he not go back to do his filial duty,

621
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,016
but he instead persuaded the family

622
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,736
to wait for a few years.

623
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,056
In the eyes of others,

624
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,256
Chen Duxiu is a great hero of righteousness.

625
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,696
But does anyone know,

626
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,256
that this is the great hero before you?

627
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,856
He lived for himself

628
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,776
and put the lives of his parents at risk.

629
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,296
That's what's so treacherous.

630
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,296
You shut up!

631
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,136
Yannian!

632
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,240
You have wronged your father by saying so!

633
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,576
After the Second Revolution,

634
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,256
Your father risked his life to persuade Gong Zhenpeng's troops in Wuhu

635
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,456
to return to Anqing to fight Yuan.

636
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,536
However,

637
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,576
this Gong Zhenpeng arrested your father.

638
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,916
The notice to be executed was posted.

639
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,816
A matter of life and death,

640
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,616
your father

641
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,320
didn't even frown!

642
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,376
It was Liu Shuya who saved him later.

643
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,296
He died in Shanghai.

644
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,576
He was the most wanted man at the time.

645
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,016
A reward of one thousand yuan was offered.

646
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,816
At that time,

647
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,200
how could he possibly go back to Anqing?

648
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,096
Yannian. Do you know

649
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,896
the people who came to Shanghai to find your father?

650
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,536
They were sent by Ni Xichong.

651
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,176
It was a trap!

652
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,776
Your father risked his life to return for a funeral

653
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,256
but we stopped him.

654
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,496
He didn't go back.

655
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,462
In those days,

656
00:27:21,486 --> 00:27:24,656
he pointed to the picture of Ni Xichong every day and said

657
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,336
he wanted to eat his own flesh!

658
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,576
But what you said about your father

659
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,736
is not fair to him.

660
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,616
Then we were not wronged!

661
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,640
My grandfather, my grandmother,

662
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,336
my mother, my cousin,

663
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,400
they were not wronged!

664
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,096
Was he wronged? Was he aggrieved?

665
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,376
It's not for us to judge.

666
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,656
Today, this matter

667
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,376
is not a prank

668
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,336
because he doesn't deserve to eat this dish.

669
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,896
We did this today

670
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,496
as a way to explain to the family

671
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,096
From now on, we clear our grudges,

672
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,336
not cross each other's paths,

673
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,976
and go our separate ways.

674
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,336
If you uncles and uncles feel

675
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,536
that this is a prank

676
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,856
then we apologise to everyone

677
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,080
for scaring our uncles and aunts.

678
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,496
Aunt, we are sorry for your loss.

679
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,936
We've scared you too.

680
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,456
It was not our intention.

681
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,336
We don't hold a grudge against you.

682
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,400
Please forgive us.

683
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,671
Yannian!

684
00:28:26,695 --> 00:28:28,893
Yannian! Yannian!

685
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,576
By the way,

686
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,896
we didn't come to Shanghai to join you.

687
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,976
Let me put it to you this way,

688
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,616
we came

689
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,416
after we read the work-study initiative.

690
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,216
We decided to come to Shanghai to study French

691
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,376
and go to France to work and study.

692
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,816
We'll make our own way,

693
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,200
don't worry about it.

694
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,216
Yannian! Qiaonian!

695
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,256
Listen to me, Yannian!

696
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,040
This... I... I... you say, you say...

697
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,336
Well, those are my sons.

698
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,456
Zhong Fu, how can you laugh at that?

699
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,256
Both sons have disowned you.

700
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,776
I, Chen Duxiu, have two such wonderful sons.

701
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,360
Why can't I laugh?

702
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,496
I didn't get to give my parents a final send-off,

703
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,416
I deserve to die for that.

704
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,736
The fact that they remembered to blame me

705
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,116
shows that they are humane people.

706
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,376
The fact that they are willing to work hard rather than rely on me

707
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,256
shows that they are self-reliant and self-sufficient people.

708
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,456
In such a fragile world,

709
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,336
aren't these two qualities

710
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,920
to be congratulated?

711
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,976
Zhong Fu, you haven't said a word.

712
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,696
I'm still trying to figure out how to comfort you.

713
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,296
You, on the contrary, he's praising his son.

714
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,616
But what he said,

715
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,296
is a relief to us all.

716
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:51,967
It is.

717
00:29:51,967 --> 00:29:52,880
But Zhong Fu,

718
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,336
I've just been watching your two boys,

719
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,696
they're not normal.

720
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,464
They will be great men in the future.

721
00:29:58,488 --> 00:29:59,416
That's right!

722
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,840
These two children have high ambitions!

723
00:30:27,364 --> 00:30:28,816
Brother Mengzou.

724
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,075
Apologies to you.

725
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:31,976
You're not stingy

726
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,680
with your lotus leaf and yellow cow's trotters.

727
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,736
I accept, I accept.

728
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,576
Let's switch!

729
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,496
You're dirty. You eat this.

730
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,176
No, no, no.

731
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,376
Didn't you hear what my son said?

732
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,680
I don't deserve to eat this dish.

733
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,440
There are other dishes here.

734
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,862
So, so, so, let's do it!

735
00:30:48,886 --> 00:30:49,180
Come on!

736
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:49,800

In 1915,

742
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,496
the twenty-six-year-old Li Dazhao

743
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,056
wrote the article "Misanthropy and Self-awareness"

744
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,376
against Chen Duxiu's "Patriotism and Self-consciousness",

745
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,200
as challenge.

746
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,736
With a positive and optimistic attitude,

747
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,936
he urged the nation to rise

748
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,080
and join the movement against Yuan.

749
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,776
Improving the spirit of nationalism

750
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,536
and enouraging patriotism;

751
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,456
by this time, Li Dazhao

752
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,816
had become

753
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,840
a thoroughgoing anti-feudal activist.

755
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,016
What are you doing?

756
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,323
You scared the hell out of me.

757
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,687
Mr. Xing Yan, what brings you here?

758
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,010
Have a seat!

759
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,680
I'm going back home, just wanted to see you.

760
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,120
Please sit!

761
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,376
What's the matter? What's the panic?

762
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,320
Did something happen?

763
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,044
I may have recently become

764
00:32:34,044 --> 00:32:36,016
a thorn in the side

765
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,559
of some Japanese students.

{\an8}[Zhang Tuzhao, styled Xing Yan, revolutionary exiled to Japan]

767
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,696
They often use the pretext of supervising my classes

768
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,816
to pick fights,

769
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,896
destroying my manuscripts.

770
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,536
So when I hear a knock at the door,

771
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,240
my first thought was to hide the manuscript.

772
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,856
You attend a variety of events and make a lot of appearances,

773
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,440
it is inevitable that you will be watched.

774
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,816
Shou Chang.

775
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,840
I've heard the school has a lot to say about you.

776
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,976
Japanese universities are very strict in their administration.

777
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,896
You need to be careful.

{\an8}[Gan Yihao, student at Waseda University]

779

You have to find

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,800
a way to make the most of both your studies and the revolution.

781
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,416
I heard you. I am organizing

782
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,096
the Chinese Students Association in Japan.

783
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,896
And I'm planning to talk to Yihan

784
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,856
to start a magazine called "Minyi" (Rule of people's will)

785
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,576
as a publication of the association.

786
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,896
Inspired by the "Jiayin",

787
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,696
the "Minyi" also opposes

788
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,576
and resists Yuan Shikai's authoritarian politics

789
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,416
by commenting and discussing the current situation,

790
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,856
to foster a modern civilization

791
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,496
and promote the awakening of the people.

792
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,696
It did make me miss a lot of classes,

793
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,856
but the revolutionary situation at the moment

794
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,256
is in full swing.

795
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,056
I had a really hard time choosing.

796
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,298
This is not acceptable.

797
00:33:40,322 --> 00:33:41,296
In my opinion,

798
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,856
academics are also the essence of the revolution.

799
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,336
Now that you are in the door,

800
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,016
you must get your diploma.

801
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,216
Otherwise, it'll be a shame.

802
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,456
In fact, the usual is doing quite well.

803
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,456
In 11 subjects last school year,

804
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,376
he scored 736 points.

805
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,696
In politics and economics,

806
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,816
out of 106 students

807
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,976
he ranked in the top 40.

808
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,736
Because he's never had a high school education

809
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,336
and went straight to undergraduate school,

810
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,216
that's a good grade, it's not bad.

811
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,616
Just third place, it's a shame.

812
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,296
Third place is really not bad.

813
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,696
You're good and you're willing to work hard.

814

Academics are not a problem for you.

815
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,080
Compliance with school rules is your problem.

816
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,136
I'm really at a bit of a loss now.

817
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,376
What is more important, the revolution or school?

818
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,080
It's really hard for me to choose.

819
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,656
You put yourself out on a hot day,

820
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,816
locked up in your dorm room studying.

821
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,280
That means you know the difference.

822
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,200
What are you writing?

823
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,336
I had an appointment with Mr. Zhongfu for a debate

824
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,416
and I wrote a piece on "Misanthropy and Self-awareness"

825
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,936
in which he refuted his arguments.

826
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,096
Help me take a look

827
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,336
Alright!

828
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,840
In this, you are really above Zhong Fu in enthusiasm.

829
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,296
Speak.

830
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,216
First of all, I feel

831
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,096
the thing Mr. Zhong Fu is advocating is

832
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,120
to have a country, not for happiness.

833
00:34:59,611 --> 00:35:01,896
to not have a country, not for worrying about self-consciousness.

834
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,736
It's an argument that is pessimistic and misanthropic.

835
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,659
What is consciousness?

836
00:35:05,683 --> 00:35:07,896
Consciousness is improving the country's spirit.

837
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,296
Strive unremittingly to establish a new country.

838
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,856
We can't, for the reason this country is not lovable,

839
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,096
just stop loving the country

840
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,216
Even more we can not, just because we

841
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,145
didn't enjoy this country's love,

842
00:35:17,169 --> 00:35:18,316
we start to loathe,

843
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,740
so much so that we abandon this country.

844
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,736
I approve this point of view of yours.

845
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,856
But I feel this conscious heart of Zhong Fu's,

846
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,120
must have a deeper meaning.

847
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,856
I heard right now he's not putting a foot outside,

848
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,616
shutting his head in to find China a prescription.

849
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,456
You watch. Maybe one day

850
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,976
this can really have him give out

851
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,816
a thunderbolt from the sky.

852
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,360
Actually, the debate between Mr. Zhong Fu and I

853
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,376
was also want to push him to make a move.

854
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,016
I really want to see his muddled interior

855
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,720
in the end, to see what medicine he is selling.

856
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,016
Alright. How about this.

857
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,096
This piece of writing,

858
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,976
send it to this period's "Jiayin".

859
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,216
Arrange it tomorrow

860
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,616
and see if this Chen Zhong Fu will be provoked or not.

861
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:09,640
Okay.

862
00:36:11,154 --> 00:36:13,320
{\an8}[Mount Song Road, Shanghai French Concession]

863
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,320
Brother Meng Zou. Sit.

864
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,920
Coming to find me, what is it for?

865
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,376
To be honest,

866
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,736
I come to take refuge.

867
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,976
Workers of the printing house

868
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,280
already blocked up the front door of my house.

869
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,800
Before, didn't you already find investors?

870
00:36:35,354 --> 00:36:36,976
Finding is what I did.

871
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,576
Before, the 300 silver dollars

872
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,496
handle procedures, rent the building, rent machines,

873
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,576
we were unable to have any money left.

874
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,576
It... You see... It's just this time,

875
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,456
the capitalists have offered to withdraw their investment,

876
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,816
and I don't know for what reason.

877
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,736
I tried my best to persuade, no results.

878
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,576
With no better option, I go all over the place to find money.

879
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,296
I scrape for gold with a thin Buddha face to search for help.

880
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,136
Didn't gain anything.

881
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,976
Then right now how much are you short of.

882
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,136
The initial number

883
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,336
added to next month's 200 silver dollars of monthly loan repayment.

884
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,936
The very least is 400 silver dollars

885
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,416
to be able to maintain until the next cycle.

886
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,896
You say, my little publishing house

887
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,616
still needs allowance to supplement "Jiayin".

888
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,616
No matter what I do, I can't get the money.

889
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,280
If next period I still can't find money,

890
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,760
I'm afraid that your magazine will also prematurely end.

891
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,656
You say, the inside of this home,

892
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,056
if something like antiques are passed down,

893
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,576
calligraphy and painting and what not,

894
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,096
then at this crucial point in time

895
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,400
you can answer your worries.

896
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,856
Mengzou. Here, drink tea.

897
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,096
Thank you.

898
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,520
In a moment, have a meal here.

899
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,320
Junman.

900
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,176
Would you please go and run...

901
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,456
run to help me get Chen Zishou, Chen Zipei,

902
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,816
the two brothers to come here.

903
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,736
For what reason?

904
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,256
Just say I have to find him for an urgent matter.

905
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,400
Quickly go.

906
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,040
Okay I know now.

907
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,240
Alright.

908
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,800
Come. Drink tea.

909
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,016
Don't look miserable now.

910
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,256
Listen to me talk about that.

911
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,200
The subject of our of our first issue

912
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,336
is to tell the youth,

913
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,456
at this moment,

914
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,856
should be what kind of new generation.

915
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,736
I feel there are 6 criterion.

916
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,176
The first one...

917
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,736
Stop, stop.

918
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,296
I don't have even the slightest doubt of your brilliant thinking,

919
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,376
but we have no money, no silver.

920
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,280
Your even greater brilliance, you can't put it out.

921
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,176
Stop being miserable!

922
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,480
Listen to me!

923
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:34,696
Wait.

924
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,736
Wait, wait, wait.

925
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,000
Right now, I really have no mood to listen.

926
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,656
Let me calm down a bit.

927
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,160
You, go write your things.

928
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,176
Write your things.

929
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,176
I'll be responsible for the money situation.

930
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,960
Be steady alright?

931
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,096
Look, right now it's 3:30.

932
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,960
At 4 O'clock, the money situation will be handled.

933
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,576
Listen to me, the 6 criterion.

934
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,816
First one,

935
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,520
one must be independent and not a slave.

936
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:16,880
The so-called aggressive rather than the retreating.

937
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,496
What is called to overcome all obstacles as well as to go forward.

938
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,400
Thus, life's duty...

939
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,776
Okay I know whatever I'm going to say now.

940
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,000
It won't enter your ears.

941
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,576
Then, you come. Help me grind ink.

942
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,896
What do you want now?

943
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,976
I want you to grind ink.

944
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,080
I want to write.

945
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,000
Hurry up!

946
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,456
My characters

947
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,536
were practiced when I was depressed in the time of my exile.

948
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,376
Crooked sevens twisty eights. Looks like it's crying out a grievance.

949
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,456
So I call it bitter form.

950
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,760
Not easily taken out to show people.

951
00:40:09,626 --> 00:40:11,216
But right now,

952
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:17,960
this brother Mengzou took a lot of trouble so far for me.

953
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,816
I can't keep maintaining my personal integrity during chaotic times.

954
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,520
I am already in a desperate situation,

955
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:25,976
yet you still have the relaxed mood to write.

956
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,176
You are thinking a way out is a way out.

957
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,736
Didn't I already say,

958
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,856
this money situation, I'll deal with it.

959
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,080
Why do you still not believe me?

960
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:42,120
You... don't manage the household, you don't know firewood and rice are expensive?

961
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,776
With this talking,

962
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,256
I suddenly thought of 3 years ago.

963
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,936
At that time you took up post as Anhui province's Bai Wenyu's secretary-general,

964
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,216
I brought silver to meet you.

965
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,216
to seek a hometown‘s

966
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,840
county head commissioner's position to sit on.

967
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,936
At that time, the content of your conversation had me awaken.

968
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,256
You say at the start of this year

969
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,336
being a government official is the most dangerous most short-lived position.

970
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,376
Saying being done for means being done for.

971
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,496
You say you have money.

972
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,296
Why didn't you open a publishing house at Shanghai?

973
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,576
Firstly... it can be because of your home.

974
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,520
Plan a smooth and steady life,

975
00:41:15,497 --> 00:41:16,696
and another one,

976
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,400
you can collect funds for the revolution.

977
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,760
At that time, I listened to you. There's still today.

978
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,320
I listened to you.

979
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,336
Do you still remember?

980
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,536
Of course I remembered.

981
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,416
Can life saving words still be forgotten?

982
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,296
What you say is also right.

983
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,120
That year, those corrupt officials' deaths

984
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,336
is an runaway escape.

985
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,096
This is really similar to that book of Victor Hugo's

986
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,000
"Les Miserables"

987
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,600
Fortunately, you awakener of Les Miserables

988
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,560
still have us

989
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:53,639
this magazine to evoke the populace to awaken.

990
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,936
Zhong Fu.

991
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,416
Mr Zishou and Mr Zipei have arrived.

992
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,696
This way.

993
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,256
Brother Mengzou.

994
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,576
Brother Zhong Fu.

995
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,016
Brother Mengzou.

996
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,456
Then, you gentlemen have a chat first.

997
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,016
Good!

998
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,096
Brother Zhong Fu.

999
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,016
Why have you thought of us brothers today

1000
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,840
Calling us over here, what instructions do you have?

1001
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,776
I remember last time we had a gathering.

1002
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,416
Brother said I was petty.

1003
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,656
Didn't let you guys write, right?

1004
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,736
It turns out Brother Zhong Fu had us two brothers come

1005
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,376
to settle accounts from last autumn.

1006
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,896
I don't dare.

1007
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,696
Today, I invite you guys over.

1008
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,456
I want to mend my image in the hearts of the two of you.

1009
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,336
This is my humble writing that was just

1010
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,800
the two of you, please, have a laugh.

1011
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,973
This is really too good.

1012
00:43:04,997 --> 00:43:06,296
Wait, wait, wait.

1013
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,720
It's not finished yet

1014
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,960
These words of mine, I can't write them wrong.
