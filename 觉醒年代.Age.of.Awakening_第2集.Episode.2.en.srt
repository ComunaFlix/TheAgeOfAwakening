00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,160
I can't get it back with nine oxen.

189
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,400
The fire is good.

190
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,840
Why are you, Wang Menzou,

191
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,400
so stingy?

192
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,240
I'm invited to dinner,

193
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,800
not at a restaurant, but at a home.

194
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,240
How much money do you save?

195
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,880
He said it! I do save money.

196
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,480
What would you like to eat?

197
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,960
I prepared it all yesterday.

198
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,040
The cook was also taken from Zishou's house.

199
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,240
I didn't spend any mony on this.

200
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,640
I can attest.

201
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,760
What Menzou said is true in every sense of the word.

202
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
[Chen Zishou, owner of Qunyi Book Club]
Our family cook

203
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
[Chen Zishou, owner of Qunyi Book Club]
was dragged here by him.

204
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,200
Zhong Fu, I'm borrowing the cook's skills.

205
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,800
You should also write us a couple of words.

206
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,040
To each his own.

207
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,160
He gave me a reception

208
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,200
by borrowing the cook from you.

209
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,600
He should be grateful to you.

210
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,560
What's it to do with me?

211
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,840
Me!

212
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,920
Zhong Fu, who is the stingy one?

213
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,360
Of course, he's stingy one!

214
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,760
And the famous Yadong Library

215
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,560
has always been housed in this alley.

216
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,240
I've tried so many times to get him to move out

217
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,040
but he won't listen!

218
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,680
It's easy to move out!

219
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,000
Wang Mengzou, I tell you,

220
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,160
we are doing great things with a bang.

221
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,160
If you want to die,

222
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,400
just cower in the alleyway.

223
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,560
If you want to live,

224
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,640
you have to move out of the alleyway

225
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,520
and onto the main road.

226
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,080
All right, all right.

227
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,600
You're standing around talking,

228
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,400
then sit down and talk.

229
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,720
Everyone sit down.

230
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:45,239
Sit down, sit down.

231
00:11:46,077 --> 00:11:46,724
[Chen Qiaonian, second son of Chen Duxiu]
Qiaonian.

232
00:11:46,724 --> 00:11:47,199
[Chen Qiaonian, second son of Chen Duxiu]

233
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,480
[Chen Qiaonian, second son of Chen Duxiu]
You're too young to hold a grudge.

234
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,680
This is a lotus leaf and yellow beef feet dish.

235
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,160
Serve it to your father.

236
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,760
Meet him.

237
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,760
Give him a surprise.

238
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,920
OK, I'll send him up later

239
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,880
and surprise him.

240
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,200
[Chen Yannian, eldest son of Chen Duxiu]
That's right!

241
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,646
[Chen Yannian, eldest son of Chen Duxiu]

242
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,600
Today, everyone invited to

243
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,200
firstly

244
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,040
celebrate Zhong Fu's return to the country.

245
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,520
That's the second.

246
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,960
Since the failure of the Second Revolution,

247
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,000
We revolutionaries

248
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,680
have been scattered to the winds.

249
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,000
We went our separate ways and hid into hiding.

250
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,280
Some died, some were wounded.

251
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,040
Today, having us all here together

252
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,880
after the disaster

253
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,280
is not easy.

254
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,120
The situation now

255
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,000
is that European powers are at war.

256
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,080
Originally it was our country's

257
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,320
time to take a break.

258
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,637
But what about the Japanese?

259
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,009
They took advantage of the situation,

260
00:12:38,478 --> 00:12:39,160
by proposing

261
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,640
the Twenty-One Demands of powers in Shandong.

262
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,200
That Yuan Shikai,

263
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,720
betrayed the country with the National Humiliation of May 9th.

264
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,600
A disgrace. It is truly a disgrace.

265
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,543
[Chen Zipei, Owner of Qunyi Book Club]

266
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,120
And now the entire country is seething,

267
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,640
protesting.

268
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,720
At this time, what should we do?

269
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,240
Observe with a critical eye?

270
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,440
Be docile subjects? Be a conquered people?

271
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,800
Never.

272
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,400
Now is the time for us to fan the flames

273
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,840
add fuel to the fire.

274
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,160
So please let us confide in each other,

275
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,520
what thoughts we have,

276
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,920
and all express our own views.

277
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,480
Yongcheng is a military man.

278
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,280
But I think the most important thing in China today

279
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:17,581
is to first defeat Yuan Shikai,

280
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
then create a republic.

281
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,320
Mengzou is right.

282
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,480
The Western European powers fighting amongst themselves

283
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,880
have no time to attend to us.

284
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,233
But Yuan Shikai

285
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,920
has no time to encircle and suppress the KMT.

286
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,600
We need to use this opportunity

287
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,760
to mobilize the masses

288
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,280
forment anti-Yuan Shikai public opinion

289
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,120
and actively prepare for hostilities against him.

290
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,560
When the time is right

291
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,800
we will rise in rebellion

292
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,440
defeat Yuan Shikai in one fell swoop

293
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,200
and create a new republic.

294
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,040
General Zou said it well.

295
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,760
I was also inspired by Brother Zhong Fu.

296
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,840
This time

297
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,080
prepare to organize Hunan personnel in Shanghai

298
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,520
set up a national salvation newspaper

299
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,080
and mobilize anti-Yuan Shikai sentiments.

300
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,440
By the way, all esteemed persons present

301
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,000
please give us your advice

302
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,480
and lend your guidance.

303
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,360
For a general to organize a newspaper commends admiration.

304
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,400
My brothers have been long involved in publishing.

305
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,400
In the future

306
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,160
if you have any use for us

307
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,440
we are yours to command.

308
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,080
We will do our best to help.

309
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,040
Mr Zhang Shizhao has already decided

310
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,120
to return to China from Japan.

311
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,680
I, Mr. Zhang and Zhong Fu

312
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,400
as well as the magazine "The Tiger" we operated

313
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,360
will also return to Shanghai from Japan.

314
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,320
Now that this Hunan-Anhui alliance has been settled

315
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,440
I believe that

316
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,080
with the leadership of

317
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,000
Mr. Zhang and Zhong Fu

318
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,600
we will definitely

319
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,760
make the newspaper a booming success.

320
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,800
Zhong Fu, don't just eat peanuts!

321
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,280
We have been waiting and waiting

322
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,040
for you to finally come back.

323
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,760
Everyone wants to hear if you have any opinions

324
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,520
or new thoughts.

325
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:44,800
Say something.

326
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,480
Yes.

327
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,760
Right, Zhong Fu.

328
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,080
The thirteenth year of Emperor Tongzhi's reign,

329
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,440
in a discussion about naval defense, Li Hongzhang

330
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,040
termed our China to be

331
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,117
at the most critical moment in 3000 years

332
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,981
facing the greatest enemy in 3000 years.

333
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,360
I would like to ask everyone present

334
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,520
what they think this crisis and this enemy

335
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,680
refers to.

336
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,080
This... What is it?

337
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,000
Since the twelfth year of Emperor Daoguang

338
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,200
when Lin Zexu sold opium

339
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,840
and the British used gunboat diplomacy

340
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,400
to force open China

341
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,400
our country

342
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,520
has been in crisis.

343
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,240
Li Hongzhang meticulously pursued Westernization, built a navy,

344
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,320
spent decades busily self-strengthening

345
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,600
And the result?

346
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,400
The Sino-Japanese War. The country collapsed after a single fight

347
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,800
helping to achieve the aims of the Japanese empire

348
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,880
From then on

349
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,400
the Qing dynasty has existed only in name.

350
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,640
And then the Xinhai Revolution.

351
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
Sun Yatsen overthrew the imperial regime and founded a republic.

352
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,560
But what is a republic?

353
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,760
Mr. Sun Yatsen has also been seeking an answer.

354
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,480
Our compariots even less able to come to agreement

355
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,440
each of us with our own opinions.

356
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,440
We anti-monarchists, Republicans who have

357
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,560
gone through fire and water

358
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,360
now must return to being docile subjects of an emperor.

359
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,280
Is history playing a joke on us?

360
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,040
So today I just want to ask

361
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,273
This most critical moment in 3000 years

362
00:16:04,392 --> 00:16:07,392
This greatest enemy in 3000 years

363
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,960
What does it really refer to?

364
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,880
Mr. Chen's words are just so insightful.

365
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,960
Hit the nail on the head with a single sentence.

366
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,720
That's right.

367
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,120
What insight?

368
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,000
It's just banal truisms.

369
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,760
I think his glib and exaggerated ways

370
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,480
is just the same as before.

371
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,000
He only boasts and causes trouble

372
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,120
without taking any responsibility.

373
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,920
As I see it

374
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,080
the crisis is the collapse of the imperial regime

375
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,320
the powerful enemy refers to the Western Powers, right?

376
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,680
Crises - China has experienced many.

377
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,760
From Qin Shihuang to Puyi

378
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,400
There has been tens of dynastic changes

379
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,720
But in the end it's still

380
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,360
exchanging one autocracy for another.

381
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,600
China has also faced many strong enemies

382
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,640
Since ancient times

383
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,520
how many enemies have battled to the Central Plains?

384
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:51,788
And the result?

385
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,280
Not only did our China not wither away

386
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,240
but like a rolling snowball grow bigger and bigger.

387
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,560
5000 years of Chinese Civilization

388
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,840
That is the advantage left to us by our ancestors.

389
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,400
So we have the self-confidence.

390
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,920
Zhongfu, what you've spoken of is history.

391
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,040
Now is no longer the past.

392
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,800
Exactly.

393
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,520
The Opium War broke this pattern.

394
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,920
This time it is really different.

395
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,480
This time we are facing

396
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,200
a truly unprecedented enemy.

397
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,280
This great enemy

398
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,840
is not only militarily strong

399
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,960
but more importantly, strong

400
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,360
in terms of ideology and theory.

401
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,640
Not only do they have

402
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,760
advanced weaponry as a result of industrial production

403
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,720
They also have advanced ideological systems

404
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,240
as a result of capitalism.

405
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,600
Compared to them

406
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,364
our system is backwards.

407
00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:45,105
Our thoughts are also backwards.

408
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,712
In short, our people are backwards.

409
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,560
For our great Chinese civilization,

410
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,200
in thousands of years, this is the first time.

411
00:17:53,402 --> 00:17:53,955
Right?

412
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
Therefore our conclusion is

413
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,389
in order to transform China,

414
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:01,720
we must first transform the minds of Chinese people

415
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,680
Improve the Suzhi of Chinese people

416
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,560
In order to recover China's former splendour

417
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
the most urgent need is

418
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,440
to bring up a new generation of people.

419
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,280
Brother Zhong Fu is right.

420
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,720
An original insight.

421
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,080
It is true that a new generation

422
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,320
is fundamental for national rejuvenation.

423
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,080
But this is too difficult.

424
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,840
It can't be accomplished overnight.

425
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,840
True. This requires a long process

426
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,080
that can't seek instant returns

427
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,680
but we also can't hesitate and dither.

428
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,200
If we have inborn talent

429
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,600
to be afraid to use it is a dereliction of duty

430
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:37,865
and leave a legacy of misfortune.

431
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,920
The likes of us cannot be

432
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,760
spectators looking on from the sidelines.

433
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,120
To be concerned, to take on the work.

434
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,480
Not be a turtle retracting its head into its shell.

435
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,120
That is our responsibility.

436
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,040
Well said, Zhong Fu.

437
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,600
What should we do?

438
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,400
First, theoretical basics.

439
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,120
Second, transformation of society.

440
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,200
Of the multitude of things

441
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,680
these two are the most important.

442
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,982
Zhong Fu,

443
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,311
there are all kinds of foreign ideologies

444
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:05,282
and all kinds of thinking.

445
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,240
Which one is suitable for our country?

446
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,440
Good question!

447
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,840
In terms advanced western ideologies and institutions,

448
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,720
we must be discriminating;

449
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,880
we must find the most key

450
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,680
the most universal, the most practical

451
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,960
to arm our youth.

452
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
I've been probing this question for many years

453
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,720
and have found a clear conclusion

454
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,560
which I will soon make known to the world.

455
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,080
That's why this time I've returned to China

456
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,000
to establish a magazine

457
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,880
that will serve as a rallying cry

458
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,200
for the political and ethical awakening of the nation!

459
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,960
I pledge to you all

460
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,920
that if I run the magazine for ten years

461
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,280
the whole country will change its thinking!

462
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,552
Well said! Good!

463
00:19:48,707 --> 00:19:49,421
Good.

464
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,960
Everyone.

465
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,160
Each generation has their duty.

466
00:19:53,622 --> 00:19:54,880
Our generation's duty is to

467
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,524
is to run this magazine

468
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,080
in order to identify, select and validate

469
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,920
one of the most advanced theories of contemporary thought

470
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,760
as a means of transforming China's youth

471
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,880
and transforming society

472
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,320
to explore a way to revitalise China.

473
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,381
Menzou, time to eat!

474
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,200
Yes, yes, yes. In the house, please. In the house, please. Come on.

475
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,640
Okay, let's eat. Let's eat.

476
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,360
In the house please, in the house.

477
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,160
Brother Zhong Fu.

478
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,120
What an enlightening experience!

479
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,240
From now on, you will be our commander-in-chief

480
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,200
and we will listen to you.

481
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,760
Serve, serve, serve.

482
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,080
Quick, Huzi, bring the tray over here.

483
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,920
Yes, ma'am.

484
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,880
Lotus leaf hooves.

485
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,080
Come, Qiaonian.

486
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,440
This one. Bring it over to your father.

487
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,360
Okay.

488
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,000
Huzi, quick.

489
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,080
Lotus leaf hooves.

490
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,000
Quick, Huzi, bring it over.

491
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,360
The first thing I propose

492
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,720
is that we drink to the wonderful opinions

493
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
we just exchanged with one another.

494
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,440
Come!

495
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,520
Not bad.

496
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,560
Fragrant.

497
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,047
Menzou,

498
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,320
just these few dishes?

499
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,720
Of course not.

500
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,360
The dishes have to be served one by one.

501
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,760
A good dish is worth the wait.

502
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,600
Don't you be worried.

503
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,200
The most substantial dish today

504
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,760
is a staple dish of my hometown Jixi, Anhui.

505
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,720
Lotus leaf hooves.

506
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Great.

507
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,880
Even in Anhui-style restaurants

508
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,280
you won't see this dish

509
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,920
because the ingredients

510
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,120
are too hard to get.

511
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,160
It's from entirely purebred

512
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,120
oxen that's three and a half years old

513
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,120
A secret recipe. Wrapped in lotus leaf.

514
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,440
Tastes exquisite.

515
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,720
The best of Anhui cuisine.

516
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,400
One for each, today.

517
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,520
Everyone has a share.

518
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,765
One for each!

519
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,800
Seven people, seven hooves.

520
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,804
That's two head of oxen.

521
00:22:11,804 --> 00:22:12,238
Right.

522
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,880
That's one substantial dish.

523
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,800
What do you think, Zhong Fu? Am I stingy?

524
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Let's taste it first.

525
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,920
Come on. Lotus wrapped hooves.

526
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,400
Here it comes.

527
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,800
Quick, Qiaonian, you go first.

528
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,320
Huzi, follow.

529
00:22:32,722 --> 00:22:33,286
Great!

530
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,360
Look, here it comes.

531
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,960
Qiaonian, how is it you?

532
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,720
Let me introduce everyone.

533
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,280
This is Zhongfu's second son, Qiaonian.

534
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,680
Wow. He's grown up!

535
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,520
What a talented young man.

536
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,520
A grown up boy.

537
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,280
Qiaonian, your old man has come back.

538
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,360
Come, go see your father.

539
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,680
I'll have one first.

540
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,760
There's one for everyone.

541
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,680
Good good good.

542
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,120
One per person.

543
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,200
Come, I give to you.

544
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,160
This is a token of respect for his father.

545
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,680
Not bad, not bad, not bad.

546
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,680
Qiaonian brought it up especially for you.

547
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,040
Grab a bite!

548
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,400
A son's filial piety to his old father.

549
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,880
Come, come, come.

550
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,040
This big yellow cow's hoof.

551
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,200
What's... what's going on here?

552
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,320
I don't know!

553
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,200
Mr. Chen, don't be angry. Mrs. Chen, don't be angry.

554
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,120
It's all my fault. My fault!

555
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,720
Sister-in-law, it's not your fault.

556
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:43,960
Qiaonian.

557
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,960
What's going on?

558
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,480
You shouldn't be the only one who did it.

559
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,600
Where are your associates?

560
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,727
Bring him here.

561
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:53,896
Chen Yannian, come out!

562
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,400
I'm the mastermind of this.

563
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,760
Take it out on me if you're angry.

564
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,680
Yannian, how old are you?

565
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,880
Are you still a child?

566
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,120
You are an adult!

567
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,160
How could you do such a ridiculous thing?

568
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,240
Even if you have a problem with your old man,

569
00:24:15,492 --> 00:24:16,640
you can't treat him like this!

570
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,920
Do you know what you call this?

571
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,760
This is called treason!

572
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,960
This would be frowned upon in our home town!

573
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,240
Heaven condemns you!

574
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,320
Sorry, Uncle Wang, Aunt Wang.

575
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,720
I've put you in a difficult position.

576
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,120
I do this today,

577
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,560
not because of him, Chen Duxiu,

578
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,840
who didn't take enough care of my mother and us two brothers.

579
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,080
In Anqing,

580
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,560
we were not rich.

581
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,320
But at least the family has some property,

582
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,600
enough for our family to live on.

583
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,920
Since he doesn't care about us,

584
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,600
we won't beg him again.

585
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,640
We're doing this today

586
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,440
for the sake of our suffering family

587
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,520
and for

588
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,360
our cousin Chen Yongnian, who has been tortured because of him,

589
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,920
to teach him a lesson.

590
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,120
To speak of treason,

591
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,560
Chen Duxiu is the one who is really

592
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,320
a treacherous hypocrite.

593
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,400
Yannian, you're going too far!

594
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440
Don't talk about your father like that!

595
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,280
You shut up!

596
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,200
Let him speak.

597
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,520
Alright.

598
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,960
Today, in front of all my uncles and aunts,

599
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm going to reveal the shame of our Chen family.

600
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,640
Everyone please judge.

601
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,200
Last autumn,

602
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,160
after the failure of the Second Revolution in Anqing,

603
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,643
Chen Duxiu himself abandons his family and flees,

604
00:25:22,157 --> 00:25:23,481
knowing the danger,

605
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,200
but still left his sick grandmother

606
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,320
and our mother and son behind.

607
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,960
Ni Xichong sent his men to raid our house.

608
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,240
My sister, Yuying, sacrificed her life to block the front hall

609
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,120
covering me and Qiaonian to jump out of the window.

610
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,960
Cousin Chen Yongnian

611
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,920
who protected his younger brother Chen Zhannian

612
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,560
was arrested for pretending to be me,

613
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,960
and was tortured to death.

614
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,960
Grandfather, who died after a long illness, was still at home

615
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,240
Grandmother is bedridden.

616
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:51,631
The family rushed to Shanghai

617
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,207
to find Chen Duxiu,

618
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,880
asking him to return for his father's funeral.

619
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,200
But he was greedy for life and death.

620
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,200
Not only did he not go back to do his filial duty,

621
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,440
but he instead persuaded the family

622
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,800
to wait for a few years.

623
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,960
In the eyes of others,

624
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,400
Chen Duxiu is a great hero of righteousness.

625
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,440
But does anyone know,

626
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,880
that this is the great hero before you?

627
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,480
He lived for himself

628
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,840
and put the lives of his parents at risk.

629
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,040
That's what's so treacherous.

630
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,200
You shut up!

631
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:24,800
Yannian!

632
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,240
You have wronged your father by saying so!

633
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,040
After the Second Revolution,

634
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,800
Your father risked his life to persuade Gong Zhenpeng's troops in Wuhu

635
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,280
to return to Anqing to fight Yuan.

636
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,200
However,

637
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,360
this Gong Zhenpeng arrested your father.

638
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,480
The notice to be executed was posted.

639
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,720
A matter of life and death,

640
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,600
your father

641
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,320
didn't even frown!

642
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,760
It was Liu Shuya who saved him later.

643
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,760
He died in Shanghai.

644
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,520
He was the most wanted man at the time.

645
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,760
A reward of one thousand yuan was offered.

646
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,760
At that time,

647
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,200
how could he possibly go back to Anqing?

648
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,880
Yannian. Do you know

649
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,440
the people who came to Shanghai to find your father?

650
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,960
They were sent by Ni Xichong.

651
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,920
It was a trap!

652
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,560
Your father risked his life to return for a funeral

653
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,200
but we stopped him.

654
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,195
He didn't go back.

655
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,200
In those days,

656
00:27:21,486 --> 00:27:24,397
he pointed to the picture of Ni Xichong every day and said

657
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,920
he wanted to eat his own flesh!

658
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,240
But what you said about your father

659
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,600
is not fair to him.

660
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,280
Then we were not wronged!

661
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,640
My grandfather, my grandmother,

662
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,280
my mother, my cousin,

663
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,400
they were not wronged!

664
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,640
Was he wronged? Was he aggrieved?

665
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,840
It's not for us to judge.

666
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
Today, this matter

667
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,880
is not a prank

668
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
because he doesn't deserve to eat this dish.

669
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,520
We did this today

670
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,520
as a way to explain to the family

671
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,040
From now on, we clear our grudges,

672
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,320
not cross each other's paths,

673
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,640
and go our separate ways.

674
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,320
If you uncles and uncles feel

675
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,080
that this is a prank

676
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,880
then we apologise to everyone

677
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,080
for scaring our uncles and aunts.

678
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,240
Aunt, we are sorry for your loss.

679
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,680
We've scared you too.

680
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,240
It was not our intention.

681
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,680
We don't hold a grudge against you.

682
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,400
Please forgive us.

683
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,046
Yannian!

684
00:28:26,695 --> 00:28:27,893
Yannian! Yannian!

685
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,120
By the way,

686
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,240
we didn't come to Shanghai to join you.

687
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,960
Let me put it to you this way,

688
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,600
we came

689
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,600
after we read the work-study initiative.

690
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,120
We decided to come to Shanghai to study French

691
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,040
and go to France to work and study.

692
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,120
We'll make our own way,

693
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,200
don't worry about it.

694
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,880
Yannian! Qiaonian!

695
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,880
Listen to me, Yannian!

696
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,040
This... I... I... you say, you say...

697
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,080
Well, those are my sons.

698
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,120
Zhong Fu, how can you laugh at that?

699
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,080
Both sons have disowned you.

700
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,160
I, Chen Duxiu, have two such wonderful sons.

701
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,360
Why can't I laugh?

702
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,200
I didn't get to give my parents a final send-off,

703
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,160
I deserve to die for that.

704
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,480
The fact that they remembered to blame me

705
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,320
shows that they are humane people.

706
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,080
The fact that they are willing to work hard rather than rely on me

707
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,080
shows that they are self-reliant and self-sufficient people.

708
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,480
In such a fragile world,

709
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,240
aren't these two qualities

710
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,920
to be congratulated?

711
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,760
Zhong Fu, you haven't said a word.

712
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,520
I'm still trying to figure out how to comfort you.

713
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,960
You, on the contrary, he's praising his son.

714
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,360
But what he said,

715
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,085
is a relief to us all.

716
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:51,967
It is.

717
00:29:51,967 --> 00:29:52,880
But Zhong Fu,

718
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,880
I've just been watching your two boys,

719
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,560
they're not normal.

720
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,357
They will be great men in the future.

721
00:29:58,488 --> 00:29:59,081
That's right!

722
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,840
These two children have high ambitions!

723
00:30:27,364 --> 00:30:28,204
Brother Mengzou.

724
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,800
Apologies to you.

725
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:31,201
You're not stingy

726
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,680
with your lotus leaf and yellow cow's trotters.

727
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
I accept, I accept.

728
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,440
Let's switch!

729
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,400
You're dirty. You eat this.

730
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,120
No, no, no.

731
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,400
Didn't you hear what my son said?

732
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,680
I don't deserve to eat this dish.

733
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,440
There are other dishes here.

734
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,600
So, so, so, let's do it!

735
00:30:48,886 --> 00:30:49,180
Come on!

736
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:49,800
Come, come, come!

737
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,280
Please, please!

738
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:50,880
Have a drink!

739
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:01,400
[Waseda University dormitory, Japan]

[Li Dazhao, styled Shou Chang, student at Waseda University]

741
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,680
In 1915,

742
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,320
the twenty-six-year-old Li Dazhao

743
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,400
wrote the article "Misanthropy and Self-awareness"

744
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,360
against Chen Duxiu's "Patriotism and Self-consciousness",

745
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,200
as challenge.

746
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,400
With a positive and optimistic attitude,

747
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,440
he urged the nation to rise

748
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,080
and join the movement against Yuan.

749
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,760
Improving the spirit of nationalism

750
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,560
and enouraging patriotism;

751
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,040
by this time, Li Dazhao

752
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,800
had become

753
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,840
a thoroughgoing anti-feudal activist.

754
00:32:11,655 --> 00:32:12,843
Shou Chang.

755
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,640
What are you doing?

756
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,323
You scared the hell out of me.

757
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,687
Mr. Xing Yan, what brings you here?

758
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,010
Have a seat!

759
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,680
I'm going back home, just wanted to see you.

760
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
Please sit!

761
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,360
What's the matter? What's the panic?

762
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,320
Did something happen?

763
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,044
I may have recently become

764
00:32:34,044 --> 00:32:35,881
a thorn in the side

765
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,559
of some Japanese students.

766
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:38,892
[Zhang Tuzhao, styled Xing Yan, revolutionary exiled to Japan]

767
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,520
They often use the pretext of supervising my classes

768
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,680
to pick fights,

769
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,760
destroying my manuscripts.

770
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,400
So when I hear a knock at the door,

771
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,240
my first thought was to hide the manuscript.

772
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,520
You attend a variety of events and make a lot of appearances,

773
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,440
it is inevitable that you will be watched.

774

Shou Chang.

775
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,840
I've heard the school has a lot to say about you.

776
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,840
Japanese universities are very strict in their administration.

777
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,680
You need to be careful.

[Gan Yihao, student at Waseda University]

779
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:05,960
You have to find

780
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,800
a way to make the most of both your studies and the revolution.

781
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,961
I heard you. I am organizing

782
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,240
the Chinese Students Association in Japan.

783
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,880
And I'm planning to talk to Yihan

784
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,440
to start a magazine called "Minyi" (Rule of people's will)

785
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,400
as a publication of the association.

786
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,880
Inspired by the "Jiayin",

787
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,680
the "Minyi" also opposes

788
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,280
and resists Yuan Shikai's authoritarian politics

789
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,120
by commenting and discussing the current situation,

790
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,840
to foster a modern civilization

791
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,200
and promote the awakening of the people.

792
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,280
It did make me miss a lot of classes,

793
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,840
but the revolutionary situation at the moment

794
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,200
is in full swing.

795
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,640
I had a really hard time choosing.

796
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,000
This is not acceptable.

797
00:33:40,322 --> 00:33:41,120
In my opinion,

798
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,640
academics are also the essence of the revolution.

799
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,120
Now that you are in the door,

800
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,840
you must get your diploma.

801
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,200
Otherwise, it'll be a shame.

802
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,400
In fact, the usual is doing quite well.

803
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,440
In 11 subjects last school year,

804
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,200
he scored 736 points.

805
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,480
In politics and economics,

806
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,800
out of 106 students

807
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,680
he ranked in the top 40.

808
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,360
Because he's never had a high school education

809
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,960
and went straight to undergraduate school,

810
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,920
that's a good grade, it's not bad.

811
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,960
Just third place, it's a shame.

812
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,240
Third place is really not bad.

813
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,560
You're good and you're willing to work hard.

814
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,160
Academics are not a problem for you.

815
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,080
Compliance with school rules is your problem.

816
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,120
I'm really at a bit of a loss now.

817
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,320
What is more important, the revolution or school?

818
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,080
It's really hard for me to choose.

819
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,520
You put yourself out on a hot day,

820
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,560
locked up in your dorm room studying.

821
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,280
That means you know the difference.

822
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,200
What are you writing?

823
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,960
I had an appointment with Mr. Zhongfu for a debate

824
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,040
and I wrote a piece on "Misanthropy and Self-awareness"

825
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,920
in which he refuted his arguments.

826
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,240
Help me take a look

827
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,120
Alright!

828
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,840
In this, you are really above Zhong Fu in enthusiasm.

829
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,501
Speak.

830
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,840
First of all, I feel

831
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,960
the thing Mr. Zhong Fu is advocating is

832
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,120
to have a country, not for happiness.

833
00:34:59,611 --> 00:35:01,083
to not have a country, not for worrying about self-consciousness.

834
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,080
It's an argument that is pessimistic and misanthropic.

835
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,640
What is consciousness?

836
00:35:05,683 --> 00:35:07,240
Consciousness is improving the country's spirit.

837
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,120
Strive unremittingly to establish a new country.

838
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,640
We can't, for the reason this country is not lovable,

839
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,800
just stop loving the country

840
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,080
Even more we can not, just because we

841
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,000
didn't enjoy this country's love,

842
00:35:17,169 --> 00:35:18,169
we start to loathe,

843
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,740
so much so that we abandon this country.

844
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,080
I approve this point of view of yours.

845
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,200
But I feel this conscious heart of Zhong Fu's,

846
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,120
must have a deeper meaning.

847
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,640
I heard right now he's not putting a foot outside,

848
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,160
shutting his head in to find China a prescription.

849
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,440
You watch. Maybe one day

850
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,960
this can really have him give out

851
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,400
a thunderbolt from the sky.

852
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,360
Actually, the debate between Mr. Zhong Fu and I

853
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,600
was also want to push him to make a move.

854
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,800
I really want to see his muddled interior

855
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,720
in the end, to see what medicine he is selling.

856
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,400
Alright. How about this.

857
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,960
This piece of writing,

858
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,920
send it to this period's "Jiayin".

859

Arrange it tomorrow

860
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,400
and see if this Chen Zhong Fu will be provoked or not.

861
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:09,200
Okay.

Coming to find me, what is it for?

865
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,000
To be honest,

866
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,680
I come to take refuge.

Before, didn't you already find investors?

870
00:36:35,354 --> 00:36:36,354
Finding is what I did.

871

873
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,960
we were unable to have any money left.

874
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,400
It... You see... It's just this time,

875
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,240
the capitalists have offered to withdraw their investment,

876
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,680
and I don't know for what reason.

877
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,600
I tried my best to persuade, no results.

878
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,280
With no better option, I go all over the place to find money.

879
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
I scrape for gold with a thin Buddha face to search for help.

880
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,800
Didn't gain anything.

881
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,800
Then right now how much are you short of.

882

added to next month's 200 silver dollars of monthly loan repayment.

884
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,920
The very least is 400 silver dollars

885
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,400
to be able to maintain until the next cycle.

886
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,880
You say, my little publishing house

887
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,280
still needs allowance to supplement "Jiayin".

888
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,320
No matter what I do, I can't get the money.

889
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,280
If next period I still can't find money,

890
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,760
I'm afraid that your magazine will also prematurely end.

Listen to me talk about that.

911
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,200
The subject of our of our first issue

912
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,160
is to tell the youth,

913
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,280
at this moment,

914
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,360
should be what kind of new generation.

915
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,280
I feel there are 6 criterion.

916
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,480
The first one...

917
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,880
Stop, stop.

918
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,920
I don't have even the slightest doubt of your brilliant thinking,

919
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,240
but we have no money, no silver.

920
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,280
Your even greater brilliance, you can't put it out.

921
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,040
Stop being miserable!

922
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,480
Listen to me!

923
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:34,680
Wait.

924
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,600
Wait, wait, wait.

925
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,000
Right now, I really have no mood to listen.

926
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,540
Let me calm down a bit.

927
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,160
You, go write your things.

928
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,960
Write your things.

929
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,800
I'll be responsible for the money situation.

930
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,960
Be steady alright?

931
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,880
Look, right now it's 3:30.

932
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,960
At 4 O'clock, the money situation will be handled.

933
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,320
Listen to me, the 6 criterion.

934
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,560
First one,

935
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,520
one must be independent and not a slave.

936
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,880
The so-called aggressive rather than the retreating.

937
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,120
What is called to overcome all obstacles as well as to go forward.

938
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,400
Thus, life's duty...

939
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,600
Okay I know whatever I'm going to say now.

940
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,000
It won't enter your ears.

941
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,200
Then, you come. Help me grind ink.

942
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,720
What do you want now?

943
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,280
I want you to grind ink.

944
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,080
I want to write.

945
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,000
Hurry up!

946
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,880
My characters

947
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,320
were practiced when I was depressed in the time of my exile.

948
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,360
Crooked sevens twisty eights. Looks like it's crying out a grievance.

949
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,320
So I call it bitter form.

950
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,760
Not easily taken out to show people.

951
00:40:09,626 --> 00:40:10,626
But right now,

952
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:16,960
this brother Mengzou took a lot of trouble so far for me.

953
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,480
I can't keep maintaining my personal integrity during chaotic times.

954
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,520
I am already in a desperate situation,

955
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:25,540
yet you still have the relaxed mood to write.

956
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,600
You are thinking a way out is a way out.

957
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,600
Didn't I already say,

958
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,000
this money situation, I'll deal with it.

959
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,080
Why do you still not believe me?

960
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,120
You... don't manage the household, you don't know firewood and rice are expensive?

961
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,000
With this talking,

962
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,880
I suddenly thought of 3 years ago.

963
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,680
At that time you took up post as Anhui province's Bai Wenyu's secretary-general,

964
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,680
I brought silver to meet you.

965
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,200
to seek a hometown‘s

966
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,840
county head commissioner's position to sit on.

967
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,760
At that time, the content of your conversation had me awaken.

968
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,040
You say at the start of this year

969
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,320
being a government official is the most dangerous most short-lived position.

970
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,760
Saying being done for means being done for.

971
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,440
You say you have money.

972
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,960
Why didn't you open a publishing house at Shanghai?

973
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,560
Firstly... it can be because of your home.

974
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,520
Plan a smooth and steady life,

975
00:41:15,497 --> 00:41:16,597
and another one,

976
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,400
you can collect funds for the revolution.

977
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,760
At that time, I listened to you. There's still today.

978
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,320
I listened to you.

979
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,081
Do you still remember?

980
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,320
Of course I remembered.

981
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,161
Can life saving words still be forgotten?

982
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,160
What you say is also right.

983
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,120
That year, those corrupt officials' deaths

984
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,320
is an runaway escape.

985
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,600
This is really similar to that book of Victor Hugo's

986
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,000
"Les Miserables"

987
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,600
Fortunately, you awakener of Les Miserables

988
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,560
still have us

989
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:52,639
this magazine to evoke the populace to awaken.

990
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,280
Zhong Fu.

991
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,520
Mr Zishou and Mr Zipei have arrived.

992
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,200
This way.

993
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,680
Brother Mengzou.

994
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:29,880
Brother Zhong Fu.

995
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:30,760
Brother Mengzou.

996
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,080
Then, you gentlemen have a chat first.

997
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,040
Good!

998
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,960
Brother Zhong Fu.

999
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,760
Why have you thought of us brothers today

1000
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,840
Calling us over here, what instructions do you have?

1001
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,600
I remember last time we had a gathering.

1002
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,280
Brother said I was petty.

1003
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,760
Didn't let you guys write, right?

1004
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,600
It turns out Brother Zhong Fu had us two brothers come

1005
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,240
to settle accounts from last autumn.

1006
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,480
I don't dare.

1007
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,400
Today, I invite you guys over.

1008
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,680
I want to mend my image in the hearts of the two of you.

1009
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,120
This is my humble writing that was just

1010
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,800
the two of you, please, have a laugh.

1011
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,280
This is really too good.

1012
00:43:04,997 --> 00:43:06,211
Wait, wait, wait.

1013
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,720
It's not finished yet

1014
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,960
These words of mine, I can't write them wrong.
