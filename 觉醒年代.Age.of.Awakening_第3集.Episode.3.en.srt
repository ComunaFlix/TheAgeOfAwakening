[The Age of Awakening]

00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,496
[Episode Three]

3
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,236
I invited you here today

4
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,956
because I want to repair my image in your minds.

5
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,836
This is the batch that just came out.

6
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,300
Please enjoy.

7
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,476
That's wonderful!

8
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,796
Wait, wait, wait!

9
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,220
It's not finished, it's not finished!

10
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,100
I can't write this for nothing.

11
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,460
It has to be commissioned.

12
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,716
Brother Zhong Fu.

13
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,356
Your writing is in a class of its own.

14
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,396
It's hard to find a good writer.

15
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,956
As long as the gentleman is willing to write for us,

16
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,036
it's not a problem.

17
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,116
Okay, then I won't charge more.

18
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,356
Two hundred silver dollars per print.

19
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,196
Don't worry, no problem!

20
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,916
Good!

21
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,500
Don't!

22
00:02:30,524 --> 00:02:31,436
Don't rush!

23
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,596
We're not done yet.

24
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,396
I'd like to write more than one.

25
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,820
One per month.

26
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,156
What do you think?

27
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,756
One per month...

28
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,796
Yes, monthly.

29
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,116
No, it's a bit strange, isn't it?

30
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,579
Aiyo...

31
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:47,959
Aiyo...

32
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:49,516
Aiyo... yoyoyo...

33
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,876
This is rare.

34
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,396
One per month!

35
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,516
I've been with Zhongfu for so many years

36
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,676
that I don't even have one of his calligraphies in my hand.

37
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,516
Naturally.

38
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,916
What about you?

39
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,020
I'll take it if you won't.

40
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,436
Brother Mengzou, Brother Zhong Fu.

41
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,876
You seem to have ulterior motives.

42
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,636
Right!

43
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,156
One per month, 200 per print.

44
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,070
We'll take it!

45
00:03:11,094 --> 00:03:11,756
Take it!

46
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,780
Good, Brother Menzou, write up the contract.

47
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,796
Brother Mengzou, what you just said,

48
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,869
Aiyo... aiyo...

49
00:03:22,893 --> 00:03:24,196
Aiyo... yoyoyo...

50
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,500
It's so faked!

51
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,860
Brother.

52
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:36,836
{\an8}[Chen Qiaonian, second son of Chen Duxiu]

53
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,076
Forget Henian,

54
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,796
but Zimei is a little girl,

55
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,020
how can she like this?

56
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,773
{\an8}[Chen Yannian, eldest son of Chen Duxiu]

57
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,876
I also want to buy her a doll.

58
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,316
But where is the money?

59
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,180
Cut quickly!

60
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,036
It's a hot day!

61
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,716
What are you two doing in the house?

62
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,836
Is it hot?

63
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,476
Come and eat watermelon. Eat watermelon.

64
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,516
Come on, it's sweet. Come on, come on.

65
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,116
Thank you.

66
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,820
Thank you Uncle Wang.

67
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,076
Let me tell you both.

68
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,156
In a moment, your father

69
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,300
will be talking to some important guests.

70
00:04:02,728 --> 00:04:04,516
{\an8}[Wang Mengzou, Manager of Yadong Library]

71
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,196
You have to think about the bigger picture.

72
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,156
Not like last time,

73
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,596
with frogs, snakes

74
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,996
mites and other messy things.

75
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,900
Do that again, I won't allow you in.

76
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,836
What's this?

77
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,100
It's for Zimei.

78
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,596
Did you hear what I just told you?

79
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,556
Don't worry, I know what's important.

80
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,436
My problem with him

81
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,996
was made clear that day.

82
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,796
He will not be embarrassed anymore.

83
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,636
That's good!

84
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,156
Your father was a great man.

85
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,580
We can't let him get distracted.

86
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,820
Zhong Fu!

87
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,916
Brother Xing Yan, I'm glad you're back!

88
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,836
Missed you so much!

89
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,516
Go, go, go!

90
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,396
General Zou.

91
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,476
Brother Xing Yan, how are you?

92
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,620
Here I come.

93
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,116
That's really for Zimei?

94
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,836
And for Henian.

95
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,876
Right, right, right.

96
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,716
You two stay inside and don't go out!

97
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,876
Eat your watermelon.

98
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,500
Alright.

99
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,076
Mr. Xing Yan!

100
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,956
Brother Mengzou!

101
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,276
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

102
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,716
Come on, come on, come on, have a seat.

103
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,956
Sit, sit, sit.

104
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,420
Have a seat.

105
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,636
Meeting Mr. Zhongshan and General Huang Xing

106
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,236
delayed a few more days on the road.

107
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,956
How's it going? What's the situation in Shanghai?

108
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,996
The anti-Yuan movement has taken root in people's hearts,

109
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,156
it is unstoppable.

110
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,756
It's just that the Yuan forces' repressive tactics

111
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,396
are getting more and more brutal.

112
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,316
Yes, there were many deaths everywhere.

113
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:24,820
But I have no doubt

114
00:05:24,786 --> 00:05:26,420
{\an8}[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhong Fu, chief editor of "Youth Magazine"]

115
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,756
that their actions will not be in vain.

116
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,060
By the way, Zhong Fu,

117
00:05:27,384 --> 00:05:29,822
{\an8}[Zhang Tuzhao, styled Xing Yan, organizer of "The Tiger" magazine]

118
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,260
you're always so efficient!

119
00:05:30,157 --> 00:05:31,224
{\an8}[Zou Yongcheng, styled Qi Zhi]

120
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,196
So many comrades gathered at once.

121
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,876
It's not that I'm efficient,

122
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,196
it's that we've all been so desperate for so long

123
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,436
that we're going crazy.

124
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,716
It's a great opportunity to be active!

125
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,556
Right, right.

126
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,636
Let's meet then!

127
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,316
Let me pass on Mr. Zhongshan's instructions

128
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,060
Alright.

129
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,796
The situation is now in our favour.

130
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,156
The world powers are at war in Europe

131
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,436
and can't be bothered with our China.

132
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,756
At home,

133
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,716
Yuan Shikai is trying to claim the throne

134
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,476
by increasing suppression of anti-Yuan activists.

135
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,876
But such a high-handed policy

136
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,236
has instead given us

137
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,756
a lot of public support.

138
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,796
Thus Mr. Zhongshan and General Huang Xing

139
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,756
asked us to take active action

140
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,980
to protect our country,

141
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,036
as soon as the time is right,

142
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,996
to overthrow Yuan Shikai's reactionary rule

143
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,356
to and create a new republic.

144
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,836
I, at the behest of Mr. Zhong Fu,

145
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,516
ran the magazine in my hometown.

146
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,716
I organized a team

147
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,676
which has now grown to over two thousand members.

148
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,396
Whenever there is an incident in Yunnan,

149
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,556
we in Hunan will be the first to respond

150
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,436
and turn the world upside down.

151
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,540
Nice work!

152
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,876
Why do I get the impression

153
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,116
that Zhong Fu is in charge of the army?

154
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,796
It's only been three days, you seem different than before.

155
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,236
I've heard you've got something big.

156
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,276
Tell us about it.

157
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,836
I can't continue fighting and quarrelling forever.

158
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,716
I'm still doing my old job, writing.

159
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,196
For the past two months, I and Baisha have been staying at home

160
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,036
running a magazine called "Youth Magazine".

161
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,396
The goal was to promote a new culture,

162
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,596
to create a new generation of young people

163
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,676
with the most advanced ideas

164
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,876
and theories in the world,

165
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,276
in order to replace the one that has ruled China for thousands of years:

166
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,756
the Three Principles of Confucianism.

167
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,516
Under the banner of science and democracy,

168
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,076
a new generation of youth will be reinvented.

169
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,276
This is a sketch of the inaugural issue.

170
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,300
Gentlemen, share your thoughts.

171
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,516
Brother Zhong Fu,

172
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,876
why is there a foreigner on this cover?

173
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,756
Who is this?

174
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,196
Carnegie!

175
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,636
The steel king and philanthropist.

176
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,876
He is Scottish.

177
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,676
At the age of eleven, he moved to America

178
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,796
and worked in a textile factory to make ends meet.

179
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,196
Firing boilers,

180
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,396
working as a courrier...

181
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,916
Then, through his own ingenuity and hard work,

182
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,716
established his own company

183
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,356
alongside Rockefeller and Morgan

184
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,220
creating a steel empire...

185
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,620
It became one of the three giants of the American economy.

186
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,996
The reason I put Carnegie

187
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,316
as the cover of our inaugural issue

188
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,116
is that we want to tell

189
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,876
the children of China who are still suffering

190
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,756
that the way of the world is left to the people of this world

191
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,796
and where there is a will, there is a way.

192
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,876
Zhong Fu, you promote new cultures and new ideas.

193
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,756
I'm all for it.

194
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,556
But if you reject Confucianism in its entirety,

195
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,756
I cannot accept.

196
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,076
Brother Xing Yan, not all of it.

197
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,036
Listen to me carefully

198
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,116
and in detail.

199
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,380
Let's go.

200
00:08:27,068 --> 00:08:30,991
{\an8}[Aurora University auditorium, Shanghai]

201
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,996
Some people say that you, Chen Duxiu, started a magazine

202
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,596
to awaken the nation's political

203
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,956
and ethical consciousness.

204
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,076
So what is this awakening?

205
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,196
As everyone knows,

206
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,396
after Lin Zexu banned opium,

207
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,476
the British invaded China.

208
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,516
With their strong ships and powerful guns,

209
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,076
we were defeated.

210
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,076
So some people suggested

211
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,036
that we should learn from the barbarians to control them.

212
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,756
This is the first awakening.

213
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,396
Knowing that you are not as good as others

214
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,956
and the need to learn from them.

215
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,836
Later on, some people also further realized

216
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,716
that we are not only inferior in skills

217
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,876
but also in country.

218
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,236
The foreigners had a more advanced system than we did,

219
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,076
so they came up with the Hundred Days' Reform and the New Deal of the late Qing Dynasty.

220
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,356
Until the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the imperial system

221
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,596
and established a republic.

222
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,916
This is the second awakening.

223
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,316
But what about the establishment of the Republic?

224
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,636
The foreigners are still bullying us.

225
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,876
The people still don't have enough to eat.

226
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,476
Here's why.

227
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,156
It's not just that we're not as good as others,

228
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,756
with a system not as good as theirs.

229
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,076
The most fundamental thing

230
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,636
is our ideological and moral philosophy.

231
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,276
which is less advanced than others.

232
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,916
That's why I say that all enlightenment

233
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,276
is ultimately the enlightenment of the mind

234
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,956
and the awareness of moral philosophy.

235
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,476
This is the final awakening.

236
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,836
In the end, it's all about human awareness.

237
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,556
This final awakening is to change our minds

238
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,956
to find the most advanced ideas in the world

239
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,756
to arm our people

240
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,476
to shape a new generation of youth

241
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,076
to create a new nation!

242
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,860
Yes! Yes! Yes!

243
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,596
For the new youth in contemporary China,

244
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,780
I think there should be six criteria.

245
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,356
First, one must be independent, not servile.

246
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,476
Second, one must be progressive, not conservative.

247
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,916
Third, one must be aggressive, not reclusive.

248
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,796
Fourth, one must be international, not isolated.

249
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,876
Fifth, one must be practical, not illusory.

250
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,796
Sixth, one must be scientific, not imaginary.

251
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,956
The six criteria are,

252
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,236
in a nutshell, that science and democracy

253
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,236
should create a new generation of young people,

254
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,836
and the only way to do this is to use both science and democracy.

255
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,076
Science and democracy are the criteria

256
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,516
by which politics, law, ethics, academia,

257
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,556
social customs

258
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,076
and the daily lives of people

259
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,476
are judged.

260
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,236
Anything that is contrary to science and democracy,

261
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,956
even if it is the legacy of our ancestors,

262
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,916
the teachings of our sages

263
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,356
and the veneration of society

264
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,196
is not worth promoting.

265
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,140
Yes! Yes! Yes!

266
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,076
Science and democracy are the sunrise,

267
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,116
but today

268
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,676
the country is a mouldy, rotten

269
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,316
sore and bleeding

270
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,436
old house that is covered up tightly.

271
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,956
How about letting the sun of science and democracy

272
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,436
shine on the house?

273
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,996
In the past we used the simplest method,

274
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,676
knocking down old houses.

275
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,996
But you knocked down the house!

276
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,476
The mould, the sores, the glue are still hidden inside.

277
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,996
What grows is still rotten and dirty.

278
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,196
So, China must be strong.

279
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,836
Not only do we need to knock down the house,

280
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,356
but more importantly,

281
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,876
we need to dig out the roots of its decay

282
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,276
to bring about a profound intellectual revolution

283
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,516
using the ideas of science and democracy

284
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,436
to arm our youth.

285
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,916
How to arm them?

286
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,396
Everyone is looking for answers.

287
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,476
My opinion is that

288
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,716
we should start with the daily life

289
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,476
that is in our hearts and minds,

290
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,876
starting with our speech and writing.

291
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,556
Promoting the vernacular,

292
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,596
to speak in words that everyone can understand

293
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,916
and write words that everyone can read.

294
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,836
We need to use the power of new literature

295
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,316
to enlighten the public mind.

296
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,961
Yes!

297
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:59,522
Well spoken!

298
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,036
September 15, 1915

299
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,540
Chen Duxiu founds the "Youth Magazine" in Shanghai.

300
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,396
The New Culture movement for the enlightenment of modern Chinese thought

301
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,020
came into being.

302
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:30,380
{\an8}[Waseda University domitory, Japan]

303
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,716
I say this Chen Duxiu

304
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,516
is really not a master of empty words.

305
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,396
Just a few months after returning to China,

306
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,676
he has done such an amazing thing.

307
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,556
It may be late autumn

308
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,036
but did you know?

309
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,356
When I took from him this "Youth Magazine",

310
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,140
I smelt a whiff of spring.

311
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:43,728
{\an8}[Li Dazhao, styled Shou Chang, student at Waseda University]

312
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,260
Chen Duxiu is not a simple man.

313
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,538
It's finally happening

314
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:52,095
{\an8}[Gao Yihan, student at Waseda University]

315
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,596
and it's a bombshell!

316
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,716
I now finally understand

317
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,380
what he meant by this self-consciousness.

318
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,756
Brother Shou Chang,

319
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,156
Two months ago you were clamouring

320
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,236
to criticise Chen Duxiu for his pessimistic and self-conscious approach to the world.

321
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,476
In the blink of an eye,

322
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,636
how did you become his best friend?

323
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,876
Right?

324
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,980
It's been two months on the island, and a thousand years in the Middle Kingdom.

325
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,516
I think at first, he said you couldn't take love of country

326
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,676
and love of that corrupt government,

327
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,756
comparing them against each other.

328
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,596
How many people are complaining?

329
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,236
But what about now?

330
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:28,180
Overthrowing Yuan has become the consensus of the whole country.

331
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,836
At this point

332
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,996
you have to admit

333
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,236
that Chen Duxiu had a great vision.

334
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,556
Too much.

335
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,596
Is that enough?

336
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,660
You're killing me.

337
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,020

00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,796
True.

510
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,196
These six criteria are good,

511
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,196
but I don't think

512
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,100
they are comprehensive enough.

513
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,260
What do you mean?

514
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,276
I just feel

515
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,076
there needs to be at least one more.

516
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,876
Be sturdy, and not frail.

517
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,940
Tell me more.

518
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,396
Everyone,

519
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,876
our nation's scholars are more often

520
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,916
bookish and frail.

521
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,356
A military spirit has not been encouraged.

522
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,276
Only when the young people boldly striving to save the country

523
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,356
are physically strong,

524
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,076
can their efforts be similarily vigorous.

525
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,316
Then the moniker bestowed on us by foreigners

526
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,836
"the sick man of Asia"

527
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,036
can be actually thrown off completely.

528
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,236
Well said. Makes sense.

529
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,076
I approve.

530
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,716
I approve as well.

531
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,060
Yes, I also agree.

532
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,876
You're getting soaked!

533
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,916
Don't worry.

534
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,620
He's just like this.

535
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,716
Civilize the mind,

536
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,276
make savage the body.

537
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,476
With both strength of body and strength of convictions

538
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,340
There's nothing on earth that's impossible.

539
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,436
Everyone,

540
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,156
This is

541
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,236
the new youth of China.

542
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,236
I've thought about it.

543
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,276
I am going to contribute to "Youth Magazine"

544
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,396
and discuss in depth

545
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,140
the physical education of Chinese people.

546
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,460
Good, good.

547
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,316
Like many young students

548
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,596
who struggled to find the truest way to save the country,

549
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,940
Moa Zedong's eyes were opened by the magazine "New Youth."

550
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,116
He started to explore

551
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,996
the ideas of the early New Culture Movement.

552
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,476
During this period,

553
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,420
he wrote these words in his diary:

554
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,796
In struggling with the sky, is there boundless joy.

555
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,396
In struggling with the earth, is there boundless joy.

556
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,820
In struggling with the people, is there boundless joy.

557
00:23:34,844 --> 00:23:35,936
Students,

558
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,956
{\an8}[Tianjin Nankai Middle School auditorium]

559
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:36,656
I read

560
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,716
{\an8}[Tianjin Nankai Middle School auditorium]

561
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,956
this newly published "Youth Magazine"

562
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,756
and was immediately attracted by the

563
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,956
inaugural address "A Call to Youth" by Mr.Chen Duxiu.
[Zhou Enlai, styled Xiang Yu, Nankai School Student]

564
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,876
It was like a bright lamp

565
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,156
that illuminated my mind,

566
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,556
It made me feel like

567
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,956
everything I've thought and learned and done before

568
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,716
was all for nought.

569
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,116
Therefore, I plan to switch

570
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,516
my oral reading

571
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,396
with this issue of "Youth Magazine"

572
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,100
to share my delight with everyone.

573
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,356
Compariots desiring to leave the age of ignorance,

574
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,436
ashamed of their simple mindedness,

575
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,556
and eager to catch up,

576
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,236
must pay equal attention to scientific knowledge and human rights.

577
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,956
Our scholars do not know science.

578
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,116
So they follow the Naturalists' School of auspicious signs and five elements.

579
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,836
Confusing the world and cheating the people.

580
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,356
Our farmers do not know science.

581
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,356
So they have no methods for seed selection or insecticide.

582
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,916
Our industrialists do not know science.

583
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,956
So goods lie wasted on the ground,

584
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,356
as we are dependent on foreign countries.

585
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,036
Our merchants do not know science.

586
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,436
So they only care about short term profits,

587
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,596
without any thought for planning for the future.

588
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,356
Our physicians do not know science.

589
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,636
So they are not acquainted with human anatomy.

590
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,396
The truth

591
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,876
in the universe is boundless.

592
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,276
The fertile realms of science awaiting the trailblazer

593
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,636
are immense!

594
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,556
Youth, take up the task!

Chinese society has many difficulties.

Mr. Chen Duxiu has shared two prescriptions with the public.

Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science

has already come to China.

602
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,116
King of steel, Carnegie.

603
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,756
That's Carnegie, not Shmarnegie.

604

Wonderful! Wonderful!

Turns out he was originally just a working boy.

Great!

See how Carnegie fulfilled the American Dream.

612
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,036
How he went from a worker to the king of steel!

He's from my hometown.

620
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,236
His name is Hu Shi.

621
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,916
When he was nineteen years old

622
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,236
he went to study abroad in the US,

623
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,156
first at Cornell University to study agricultural science,

624
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,716
then he switched his major to literature.

625
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,956
He went to Columbia University this year

626
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,436
to study with that well-known professor, John Dewey,

627
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,796
for a doctorate of philosophy.

628
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,276
It can be said that this child

629
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,316
is proficient in literature, history, and philosophy.

630
00:26:17,317 --> 00:26:18,916
He saw an issue of our "Youth Magazine"

631

{\an8}[Yi Baisha, styled Yue Cun, New Culture Movement activist]

and was very excited.

00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,460
He's sent a letter

634
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,636
and wants to write an article regarding the revolution in literature.

635
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,460
So I would like to solicit your opinions.

636

That's great!

637
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,020
This topic of literary revolution is great.

638
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,516
I really didn't expect

639
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,716
a student who has been overseas for years

640
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:46,076
to be capable of seeing the purpose of my magazine

641
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,636
so incisively.

642
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,620

Alright, Zhong Fu

648
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,476
can get you so excited?

649
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,516
Aren't you too ridiculous?

650
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,780
Not by half!

651
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,140
Ideological guidance cannot be idle chit-chat,

652
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,556
but start from a concrete basis

653
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,196
that focuses on the lives of the masses.

"Literary Revolution: A Tentative Proposal"

655

If this article is written properly,

656
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,996
it will be a bombshell!

657
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,116

00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,596
is too important for our "Youth Magazine."

660
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,596
Must grab him!

661
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,580
Oh Zhong Fu,

662
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,036
in this time and age,

663
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,796
it's not easy to find a genius

664
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,236
who can catch your eye.

665
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,036
Though don't get too hung up on it.

666
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,756
This guy is a doctoral student in the United States,

667
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,596
and a disciple of Professor Dewey.

668
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,636
As if you can grab him just by saying so.

669
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,876
This guy lives in the United States.

670
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,476
Whether he can even come back is an issue.

671
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,076
No, no. This I can guarantee.

672
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,676
He will definitely return to China after completing his studies.

673
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,980
How can one be sure?

674
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,516
This guy, Hu Shi,

675
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,356
is a filial son.

676
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,036
Before he went abroad to study,

677
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,036
his mother arranged a marriage for him.

678
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,196
His mother can't wait to get a grandson.

679
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,836
So she writes him letters every few days

680
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,716
telling him to come back after he finishes his studies to get married.

681
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,356
He would not dare to disobey his mother.

682
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,436
This person is really too wonderful.

683
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,876
His thinking is wonderful.

684
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,156
What?

685
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,856
Grab him!

686
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,580
Grab him as soon as he comes back.

687
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,796
Junman!

688
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,860
Here, let me.

689
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,076
Why is your cough so bad?

690
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,276
You took your medicine?

691
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,660
I did. It's not effective.

692
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,916
It's not effective?

693
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,076
You have to keep taking it.

694
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,156
How can the medicine work if you don't keep taking it?

695
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,356
I've finished it.

696
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,636
But there were no results.

697
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,860
You've finished it.

698
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,996
Ok, alright.

699
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,396
Don't work any more.

700
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,436
Go rest in the house.

701
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,676
Let me sit here for a bit.

702
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,340
Get some air.

703
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,700
Then wait. I will go buy medicine.

704
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,756
You don't need to go.

705
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,956
The drawer has long run out of money.

706
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,796
The money you gave me last month is all used up.

707
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,516
It's an old problem.

708
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,676
It'll pass.

709
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,340
Don't worry. I'm not dying.

710
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,076
Gao Junman!

711
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,356
Don't work anymore!

712
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,396
No one's dying if the firewood's not chopped.

713
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,300
Go inside and rest.

714
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,140
Wait for me.

715
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,916
No one's dying if the firewood's not chopped.

716
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,660
Can't cook if the firewood's not chopped!

717
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,236
Zhong Fu,

718
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,316
why are you here in such a heavy rain?

719
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,916
Just dropping by.

720
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,220
Pour your own tea if you want.

721
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,140
Those the accounts?

722
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,076
So today,

723
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,516
I ran around to collect the money.

724
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,596
To date, our "Youth Magazine"

725
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,276
has sold 2000 copies in total,

726
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,876
breaking even.

727
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,540
The principal has basically been recouped.

728
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,580
That's great.

729
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,620
That's a good thing, right?

730
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,860
Mengzou,

731
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,316
My uh...

732
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,036
This issue's payment for uh,

733
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,556
for my editorial.

734
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,196
Is that included in the capital?

735
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,636
I'm calculating the big accounts.

736
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,356
Haven't had a chance yet to take you into consideration.

737
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,516
Hold on, you have to take me into consideration as well.

738
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,236
If your capital has been recouped

739
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,916
then shouldn't the payment for my editorial

740
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,460
be given back to me?

741
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,636
Alright, then let me take you into consideration right now.

742
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,980
Let me see,

743
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,836
Your manuscript fee, editorial fee

744
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,756
added together

745
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,676
is 138 silver dollars.

746
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,396
However, you've asked three times for an advance.

747
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,356
The first time, for 4 silver dollars.

748
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,236
The second time, also for 4 silver dollars.

749
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,396
The third time, for 10 silver dollars.

750
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,036
18 all together.

751
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,276
138 minus 18

752
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,116
So you should get

753
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,876
120 silver dollars, correct?

754
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,420
I'll give it to you right now.

755
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,380
Fifty.

756
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,380
One hundred.

757
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,316
One twenty.

758
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,676
Take it.

759
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,556
I borrowed money three times.

760
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,436
Two $4 and one $10.

761
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,916
Why don't I have any impression of this?

762
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,996
These matters, you don't need to think over it.

763
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,396
These are the matters I'll look after.

764
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,956
As for you, great thinker

765
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,116
just unhesitatingly let out your brilliance.

766
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,316
Zhong Fu,

767
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,436
you say, this Yuan Shikai,

768
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,556
his determination to be the emperor

769
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,636
makes the heavens angry and causes people to resent.

770
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,396
This authority, right now also has no time

771
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,116
to deal with the revolutionaries.

772
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,716
As soon as the current political situation starts to ease

773
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,036
this business opportunity, it will come.

774
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,956
I want to seize onto the opportunity, go out and raise capital.

775
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,116
With your great persona, you will have a lot of acquaintances.

776
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,276
Bring over more people with money to invest.

777
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,716
This magazine of ours, maybe it will resume operations.

778
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,356
Alright. No problem.

779
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,756
You're responsible for finding people, I'll show up personally.

780
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,196
As long as the magazine can be managed well,

781
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,116
whatever you have me do is fine.

782
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,796
Uncle Wang.

783
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,340
You've come back.

784
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,940
Dad.

785
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,356
Why have you come back so early today?

786
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,940
It's raining today, impossible to work.

787
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,636
Mengzou

788
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,436
This... Yannian and Qiaonian doing editing here,

789
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,276
isn't it that they should have pay too?

790
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,676
I gave it to them, Yannian didn't want it.

791
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,356
Speaking about this pay,

792
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,940
it's made up for in my accommodation fees here.

793
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,876
I want to properly discuss with you,

794
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,396
these two children's matters.

795
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,636
In the daytime, they are working at the port.

796
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,636
At night, they come over to my place to be editors.

797
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,396
And they still need to learn French.

798
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,276
Wouldn't you say these two children are too tired

799
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:08,996
That is to say, the two brothers living costs right now,

800
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,916
all depends on the salary from working at the port.

801
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,076
That's right.

802
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,396
I have also heard, at the port they

803
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,236
extended the working time.

804
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,996
I quietly asked Qiaonian

805
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,436
what's going on?

806
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:24,580
He said it's for getting the tuition to learn French.

807
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,340
You say, what to do?

808
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,476
This child, right now

809
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,276
when his body is still growing.

810
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,676
If he's like this, wouldn't his body break down?

811
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,180
You say, what to do with this?

812
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,276
Those two, if they didn't want the editing pay,

813
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,156
you should give it me.

814
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,556
I am his father.

815
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,156
It should be me... Receiving it...

816
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,716
It should be normal too, right?

817
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,356
What! This is...

818
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,396
That's another matter!

819
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,156
Didn't I already tell you?

820
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,076
Yannian had the pay

821
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,436
included it in the accommodation fees here.

822
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,916
You still say your son and you are very similar,

823
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,556
not even a little similar.

824
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,396
He, give him money and he doesn't want it.

825
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:06,020
You here, keep going on and on with me.

826
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,300
This is 50 silver dollars.

827
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,860
100 silver dollars.

828
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:29,796
This is 20.

829
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,756
Dad, what are you giving me so much..

830
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,716
Listen to me.

831
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,956
This money, I give it to you two brothers to pay tuition.

832
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,636
Understand?

833
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,260
Quickly go.

834
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,556
Zhong Fu.

835
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,620
You already gave it.

836
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,236
Mengzou.

837
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,716
You say, just now

838
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:57,036
said something like I borrowed money three times.

839
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,956
$4 twice, $10 once.

840
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,596
When was that?

841
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,596
How come I don't have any impression.

842
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,396
Let me look at the account.

843
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,876
Don't talk about these things with me anymore.

844
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,876
I'll draw some money for you again,

845
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,116
not for drawing some money for myself.

846
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,580
I'll look at the account. How come I didn't...

847
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,780
Stop there!

848
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,356
Chen Yannian!

849
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,516
This money is to give you two brothers to pay tuition.

850
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,516
Am I wrong?

851
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,500
Don't need it.

852
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,196
Today, you say it to me clearly.

853
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,180
What is it about me that you are so against?

854
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,556
You are too greedy.

855
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:40,420
You want both a family and to love your country.

856
00:35:38,426 --> 00:35:40,556
I do want both a family and to love my country.

857
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,756
Is there a contradiction between these two?

858
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,796
There is a contradiction.

859
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,076
If you want to love your country, then you must give up the family.

860
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,396
Otherwise, you will only give the family

861
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,916
an even greater harm.

862
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,756
You really feel your assertion has value?

863
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,316
At least, currently, yes.

864
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,516
Good! Then you keep insisting!

865
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,740
Go! Go!

Being older, wants to chat

869
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,180
but it collapses with a single conversation.

Shou Chang

872
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,036
Did you see the announcement at the school's entrance?

873
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,636
The school is known for its long-standing lack of learning.

874
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,196
You have been expelled!

875
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,156
I saw it. This was within my expectations.

876
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,596
I've been struggling for months.

877
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,076
It's done now. I've got a result.

878
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,716
I can completely focus on taking care of the revolution now.

Brother Shouchang

880
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,836
It's completely me who harmed you

881
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,676
At that time, I really shouldn't have insisted on pulling you

882
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,356
to be the editor-in-chief of "Minyi" magazine.

883
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,956
You were originally at the Foreign Students Assocation in Japan

being the head editor in the literature and history committee

were already very busy.

886
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,356
It doesn't have to do with you.

887
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,516
It's I who likes to edit magazines.

888
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,196
Right now, Yuan Shikai acts an emperor.

889
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,036
The country is already successfully thrown into a complete mess.

890
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,436
I absolutely can not calm down my heart to read books.

891
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,556
What plans do you have?

892
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,716
First, wholeheartedly

893
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,636
edit the first issue of "Minyi" magazine

894
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,836
have it become the rallying cry that denounces Yuan Shikai.

895
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:15,140
Then, I'll return to the country. Head to the battlefield.

896
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,396
Listening to you like this, I also can't sit still.

897
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,876
Anyway, I am also graduating soon

898
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,596
When the time comes, I'll return with you.

899
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,916
but returning to the main topic,

900
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,516
if we're really going to the firing line to fire guns and battle.

901
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,980
I don't know if I can do it.

902
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,996
Who says you have to fight Yuan with real weapons?

903
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,836
Chen Duxiu's ideological enlightenment of the youth

904
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,996
was the same as the Yuan struggle.

905
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,516
Moreover, he did it from the roots.

906
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,556
It's not bad compared to the results of a firearm.

907
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,236
Shouchang, I heard that his magazine

908
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,636
ran into big trouble.

909
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,996
Already stopped publishing.

910
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,036
I know.

911
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,396
Small trouble. It's almost resolved.

912
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,580
Just change the publication name, and it's fine.

913
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,716
Right now, I am in the middle of

914
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,596
writing an article for the relaunch issue.

915
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,220
You are? Can I take a look?

916
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,300
What a great title for "Youth".

917
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,860
This long?

918
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,076
I'll read it to you. You try to feel it.

919
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,540
Yes, yes.

920
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:14,940
When the Earth turns white,

921
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:20,156
we are still in our youth.

922
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,316
We use our youth,

923
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,116
To softly change earth's whiteness.

924
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:30,676
Although old, yet not old

925

That is, our youth exists for one day.

927
00:38:39,054 --> 00:38:42,016
Our youth exists for one day.

That is, the youth of the earth exists for one day.

"Youth", in Japan.

932
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,476
The article used an uplifting revolutionary spirit

933
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,636
and a scientific approach to humanism

934
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:06,116
expressing an clear materialistic ideology,

935
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:10,940
proposing the ideal of rejuvenating China's youth.

936
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,076
Calling young people

937
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,956
to break through the snares of past history,

938
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:19,140
destroy stereotypical doctrines,

939
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:23,116
use the spirit of youth to continuously transform oneself,

940
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,956
use the vitality of youth, the ideals of youth

941
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,396
to wake up the old China from the century of dormancy,

942
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,140
and establish a youthful China.

943

you guys even came to see me. Good!

don't know if he doesn't welcome me back.

"Youth Magazine" became renowned with other people.

00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,596
It was sued by others for breach of reputation

959

and so stopped publishing.

second is to launch a campaign for a work-study program for those who will stay in France.

976

Let me test you guys.

978
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,116
Nowadays, what is the most popular theory in the West?

979
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,556
Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution!

980
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,916
That's not simple,

981
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:56,916
who told you this?

982
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,076
I overheard it too

983
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,596
Hunan and Anhui comrades held a meeting.

984
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,436
Chen Duxiu gave everyone

985
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,156
an explanation on the Theory of Evolution all morning

986
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,876
saying that natural selection is an unchanging truth

987
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,756
and is the motivation for human progress

988
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,996
In this, Chen Duxiu is ignorant and narrow-minded.

989
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,636
He only knows the first thing and not the second.

990
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,636
Actually, the popular theory nowadays

991
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,716
is not Darwin's Theory of Evolution,

992
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:21,236
rather it's Kropotkin's Theory of Mutual Assistance.

993
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,236
Come.

994
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,396
This is some material from France that I specially

amidst the outcry at home and abroad

1003
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,716
Yuan Shikai was forced to cancel his autocratic monarchy.

1004
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,916
A shameful performance full of a farce to restore an autocratic monarchy

1005
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,196
came to a premature end.

1006
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,276
Since the Xinhai Revolution,

1007
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,116
due to the fact that in China

1008
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,116
the idea to establish a bourgeois republic

1009
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,996
was out of step with the Chinese situation,

1010
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,596
the old democratic revolution

1011
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,396
lead by China's bourgeoisie

1012
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,876
cannot obtain the extensive support of the working class.

1013
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,236
Hitting a wall in all directions. Suffering defeat in every battle.

1014
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,300
A difficult situation.

1015
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,916
Yuan Shikai, who represents the feudal power of China

1016
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,516
was regarded as taking away the achievements of the Xinhai Revolution, and met with contempt after his death.

1017
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:20,236
Revolutionists who were forced into exile overseas returned to the country one after another

1018
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,236
Li Dazhao

1019
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,596
invited to visit Beijing

1020
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,396
took the post of editor-in-chief of "Morning Bell" newspaper.

1021
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,636
At this time, after the baptism of the anti-Yuan movement

1022
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,396
initially accepting

1023
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,036
the historical materialism point of view, Li Dazhao

1024
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:37,660
already became a revolutionary full of new ideas.

1025
00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:50,183
{\an8}[Qianmen Street, Beijing]

1026
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:53,116
Brother. Where is your home?

1027
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,676
Outside Yongdingmen. The pariah.

1028
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,236
Why do you say this?

1029
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,036
Those who pull carts, wield skill in trade

1030
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,356
have shaved heads, are pig butchers, coffin carriers,

1031
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,436
all live over there.

1032
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,276
Then how is getting by in life right now for you guys?

1033
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,676
Impossible to get by. Everyone's suffering until they can't take it anymore.

1034
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,876
According to the older generations' saying,

1035
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,460
we have never gone through such sullen days.
