[Episode Three]

3
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,900
I invited you here today

4
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,180
because I want to repair my image in your minds.

5
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,620
This is the batch that just came out.

6
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,300
Please enjoy.

7
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,780
That's wonderful!

8
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,620
Wait, wait, wait!

9
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,220
It's not finished, it's not finished!

10
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,100
I can't write this for nothing.

11
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,460
It has to be commissioned.

12
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,460
Brother Zhong Fu.

13
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,020
Your writing is in a class of its own.

14
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,260
It's hard to find a good writer.

15
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,780
As long as the gentleman is willing to write for us,

16
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,900
it's not a problem.

17
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,700
Okay, then I won't charge more.

18
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,100
Two hundred silver dollars per print.

19
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,940
Don't worry, no problem!

20
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,860
Good!

21
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,402
Don't!

22
00:02:30,524 --> 00:02:31,365
Don't rush!

23
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,460
We're not done yet.

24
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,860
I'd like to write more than one.

25
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,820
One per month.

26
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,940
What do you think?

27
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,620
One per month...

28
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,620
Yes, monthly.

29
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,820
No, it's a bit strange, isn't it?

30
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,243

Aiyo... yoyoyo...

33
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,700
This is rare.

34
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,180
One per month!

35
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,020
I've been with Zhongfu for so many years

36
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,540
that I don't even have one of his calligraphies in my hand.

37
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,380
Naturally.

38
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,180
What about you?

39
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,020
I'll take it if you won't.

40
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,300
Brother Mengzou, Brother Zhong Fu.

41
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,700
You seem to have ulterior motives.

42
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,460
Right!

43
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,020
One per month, 200 per print.

44
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:10,967
We'll take it!

45
00:03:11,094 --> 00:03:11,740
Take it!

46
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,780
Good, Brother Menzou, write up the contract.

47
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,460

But where is the money?

59

Cut quickly!

62
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,620
Is it hot?

63
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,260
Come and eat watermelon. Eat watermelon.

64
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,380
Come on, it's sweet. Come on, come on.

65

77
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,100
It's for Zimei.

78

79

How's it going? What's the situation in Shanghai?

108
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,820
The anti-Yuan movement has taken root in people's hearts,

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,020
it is unstoppable.

110
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,620
It's just that the Yuan forces' repressive tactics

111

are getting more and more brutal.

112
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,740
Yes, there were many deaths everywhere.

It's not that I'm efficient,

122
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,060
it's that we've all been so desperate for so long

123
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,660
that we're going crazy.

124
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,220
It's a great opportunity to be active!

125
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,540

Alright.

The situation is now in our favour.

130
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,980
The world powers are at war in Europe

131
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,300

by increasing suppression of anti-Yuan activists.

135
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,660
But such a high-handed policy

136
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,060
has instead given us

137
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,500
a lot of public support.

138
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,780
Thus Mr. Zhongshan and General Huang Xing

139
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,740

to protect our country,

141
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,020

Whenever there is an incident in Yunnan,

149

Nice work!

152
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,860
Why do I get the impression

153
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,660
that Zhong Fu is in charge of the army?

154
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,380
It's only been three days, you seem different than before.

155
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,060
I've heard you've got something big.

156
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,180
Tell us about it.

157
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,580
I can't continue fighting and quarrelling forever.

158
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,220
I'm still doing my old job, writing.

159
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,860
For the past two months, I and Baisha have been staying at home

160
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,420
running a magazine called "Youth Magazine".

161
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,620
The goal was to promote a new culture,

162
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,580
to create a new generation of young people

163
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,660
with the most advanced ideas

164
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,300
and theories in the world,

165
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,020
in order to replace the one that has ruled China for thousands of years:

166
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,620
the Three Principles of Confucianism.

167
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,340
Under the banner of science and democracy,

168
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,820
a new generation of youth will be reinvented.

169
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,820
This is a sketch of the inaugural issue.

170
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,300
Gentlemen, share your thoughts.

171
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,420
Brother Zhong Fu,

172
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,860
why is there a foreigner on this cover?

173
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,500
Who is this?

174
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,980
Carnegie!

175
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,460
The steel king and philanthropist.

176
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,700
He is Scottish.

177
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,060
At the age of eleven, he moved to America

178
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,340
and worked in a textile factory to make ends meet.

179
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,060
Firing boilers,

180
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,220
working as a courrier...

181
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,700
Then, through his own ingenuity and hard work,

182
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,500
established his own company

183
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,180
alongside Rockefeller and Morgan

184
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,220
creating a steel empire...

185
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,620
It became one of the three giants of the American economy.

186
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,820
The reason I put Carnegie

187
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,940
as the cover of our inaugural issue

188
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,940
is that we want to tell

189
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,140
the children of China who are still suffering

190
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,300
that the way of the world is left to the people of this world

191
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,140
and where there is a will, there is a way.

192
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,500
Zhong Fu, you promote new cultures and new ideas.

193
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,220
I'm all for it.

194
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,260
But if you reject Confucianism in its entirety,

195
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,740
I cannot accept.

196
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,460
Brother Xing Yan, not all of it.

197
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,020
Listen to me carefully

198
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,100
and in detail.

199
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,380
Let's go.

200
00:08:27,068 --> 00:08:29,991
[Aurora University auditorium, Shanghai]

201
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,260
Some people say that you, Chen Duxiu, started a magazine

202
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,580
to awaken the nation's political

203
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,700
and ethical consciousness.

204
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,660
So what is this awakening?

205
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:48,940
As everyone knows,

206
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,100
after Lin Zexu banned opium,

207
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,220
the British invaded China.

208
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,100
With their strong ships and powerful guns,

209
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,900
we were defeated.

210
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,860
So some people suggested

211
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,780
that we should learn from the barbarians to control them.

212
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,500
This is the first awakening.

213
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,140
Knowing that you are not as good as others

214
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,780
and the need to learn from them.

215
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,540
Later on, some people also further realized

216
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,580
that we are not only inferior in skills

217
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,620
but also in country.

218
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,020
The foreigners had a more advanced system than we did,

219
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,860
so they came up with the Hundred Days' Reform and the New Deal of the late Qing Dynasty.

220
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,220
Until the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the imperial system

221
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,460
and established a republic.

222
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,380
This is the second awakening.

223
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,020
But what about the establishment of the Republic?

224
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,060
The foreigners are still bullying us.

225
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,460
The people still don't have enough to eat.

226
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,300
Here's why.

227
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,020
It's not just that we're not as good as others,

228
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,500
with a system not as good as theirs.

229
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,940
The most fundamental thing

230
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,060
is our ideological and moral philosophy.

231
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,940
which is less advanced than others.

232
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,620
That's why I say that all enlightenment

233
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,100
is ultimately the enlightenment of the mind

234
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,700
and the awareness of moral philosophy.

235
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,260
This is the final awakening.

236
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,700
In the end, it's all about human awareness.

237
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,380
This final awakening is to change our minds

238
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,780
to find the most advanced ideas in the world

239
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,500
to arm our people

240
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,340
to shape a new generation of youth

241
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,860
to create a new nation!

242
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,860
Yes! Yes! Yes!

243
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,460
For the new youth in contemporary China,

244
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,780
I think there should be six criteria.

245
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,140
First, one must be independent, not servile.

246
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,060
Second, one must be progressive, not conservative.

247
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,580
Third, one must be aggressive, not reclusive.

248
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,580
Fourth, one must be international, not isolated.

249
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,740
Fifth, one must be practical, not illusory.

250
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,380
Sixth, one must be scientific, not imaginary.

251
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,820
The six criteria are,

252
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,100
in a nutshell, that science and democracy

253
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,060
should create a new generation of young people,

254
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,540
and the only way to do this is to use both science and democracy.

255
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,060
Science and democracy are the criteria

256
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,380
by which politics, law, ethics, academia,

257
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,460
social customs

258
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,940
and the daily lives of people

259
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,100
are judged.

260
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,620
Anything that is contrary to science and democracy,

261
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,460
even if it is the legacy of our ancestors,

262
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,340
the teachings of our sages

263
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,220
and the veneration of society

264
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,940
is not worth promoting.

265
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,140
Yes! Yes! Yes!

266
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,660
Science and democracy are the sunrise,

267
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,100
but today

268
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,500

269
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,100

271
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,740
How about letting the sun of science and democracy

272
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,420
shine on the house?

273
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,780
In the past we used the simplest method,

274
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,500
knocking down old houses.

275
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,180
But you knocked down the house!

276
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,180

What grows is still rotten and dirty.

278
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,980
So, China must be strong.

279

but more importantly,

My opinion is that

288
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,620
we should start with the daily life

289
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,300

290
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,060

and write words that everyone can read.

294

Here, try it.
[He Shuheng, student at Hunan Provincial First Normal School]

371
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:39,940
You too.

372
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,620
You've misunderstood

373
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,380
this classmate.

374
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:43,900
He is

375
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,260
looking for a friend

376
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,940
with the same common purpose of serving the country.

377
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,660
How grand.

378
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,140
You all

379
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,420
seem to be making a pact of brotherhood.
[Ge Jianhao, mother of Cai Heseen]

380
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,020
Who is this '28 Strokes Student'?

381
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,020
Ma, '28 Strokes Student'

382
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,860
is Mao Zedong.

383
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,380
You know, Runzhi.

384
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,500
Oh, Runzhi.

385
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,620

Which one of you is '28 Strokes Student'?
[Xiao Zisheng, student at Hunan Provincial First Normal School]

389
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,820
Hello, hello.

390
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,780
I am here to apply for the meeting of friends.

391
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,060
My name is Cai Hesen.

392
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:19,700
How do you do?

393

This is Xiao Zisheng.

394

My hands are covered with ink.

403
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:35,740
Ok.

404

00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,860
28 Strokes Student is back.

Mother Ge.

407
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,060
You've worked hard.

408
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,700
Runzhi,

409
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,420
What are you talking about?

410
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,140
"Sent to the foothills"

411
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,020
"Hidden in the famous mountains"

412
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,140
Ah, right.

413
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,020
From "The Book of Documents"

414
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,020
"Sent to the foothills"

415
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,820
"Though he is late because of thunder and rain, he is not lost."

416
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,860

Please sit.

Take a look at my treasure.

Sure.

434
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,740

To the side.

Lost your manners?

00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,180
Look.

00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,820
This is my treasure.

444
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,860
One for each.

445
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,820
One book a person.

446
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:49,940
Today,

447
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,300
at our recruitment meeting,

448
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,100
let's discuss this,

449
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,220
and nothing else.

450
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,420
Come, take a look.

451
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,020
Look at this first,

452
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,460
Look, look.

453
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,660
This really is a treasure.

454
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,700
Everyone,

455
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,300
This is Mr. Chen Duxiu's "The Youth Magazine."

456
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,420
Mr. Yang Changji

457
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,100
has already recommended it to us many times.

458
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,340
He says it is the prescription to save the nation.

459
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,940
Run Huan is right.

460
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,220
This is the remedy that will save lives.

461
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,540
I've only

462
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,540
briefly skimmed the founding statement.

463
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:15,980
Reading

464
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,100
"A Call to the Youth"

465
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,260
I felt as if

466
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,940
I've been struck by a thunderbolt.

467
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,180
Absolutely enlightening!

468
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,140
Runzhi,

469
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,180
You've bought so many issues at once.

470
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,060
How are you going to eat this month?

471
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,180
'Tis enough to have this book.

472
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,700
Runzhi,

473
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,140
don't worry and read your book.

474
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,500
If you do get hungry

475
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,740
come to Mother Ge

476
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,580
and you'll definitely

477
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,820
eat your fill.

478
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,220
Here. Great.

479
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,260
I'm actually hungry.

480
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,660
You've reminded me.

481
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,060
Mother Ge,

482
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,860
remember to make it spicy.

483
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,340
The very spicy kind.

484
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,700
Got it for you.

485
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,540
Thank you!

486
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:54,980
Everyone,

487
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,780
I'm so energized.

488
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,060
Haven't we always been talking

489
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,740
about creating a new people?

490
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,340
Well, what is the new youth?

491
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,500
Mr. Chen Zhongfu

492
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,260
right here

493
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,660
talks about six criteria.

494
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,780
Be independent, and not servile.

495
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,340
Be progressive, and not conservative.

496
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,060
Be aggressive, and not retiring.

497
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,380
Be cosmopolitan, and not isolationist.

498
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,820
Be utilitarian, and not formalistic.

499
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,220
Be scientific, and not fanciful.

500
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,340
Wonderfully put!

501
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,340
The six criteria proposed by Mr. Zhongfu

502
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,780
is exactly the direction to work towards

503
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,900
for my generation.

504
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,420
True.

505
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,860
These six criteria are good,

506
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,140
but I don't think

507
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,100
they are comprehensive enough.

508
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,260
What do you mean?

509
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,220
I just feel

510
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,660
there needs to be at least one more.

511
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,980
Be sturdy, and not frail.

512
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,940
Tell me more.

513
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,380
Everyone,

514
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,700
our nation's scholars are more often

515
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,700
bookish and frail.

516
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,660
A military spirit has not been encouraged.

517
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,820
Only when the young people boldly striving to save the country

518
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,060
are physically strong,

519
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,060
can their efforts be similarily vigorous.

520
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,220
Then the moniker bestowed on us by foreigners

521
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,700
"the sick man of Asia"

522
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,940
can be actually thrown off completely.

523
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,100
Well said. Makes sense.

524
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:01,740
I approve.

525
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,700
I approve as well.

526
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,060
Yes, I also agree.

527
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,860
You're getting soaked!

528
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,660
Don't worry.

529
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,620
He's just like this.

530
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,700
Civilize the mind,

531
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,980
make savage the body.

532
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,060
With both strength of body and strength of convictions

533
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,340
There's nothing on earth that's impossible.

534
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,020
Everyone,

535
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,140
This is

536
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,620
the new youth of China.

537
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,180
I've thought about it.

538
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,020
I am going to contribute to "Youth Magazine"

539
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,340
and discuss in depth

540
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,140
the physical education of Chinese people.

541
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,460
Good, good.

542
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,300
Like many young students

543
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,820
who struggled to find the truest way to save the country,

544
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,940
Moa Zedong's eyes were opened by the magazine "New Youth."

545
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,100
He started to explore

546
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,060
the ideas of the early New Culture Movement.

547
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,740
During this period,

548
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,420
he wrote these words in his diary:

549
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,140
In struggling with the sky, is there boundless joy.

550
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,320
In struggling with the earth, is there boundless joy.

551
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,820
In struggling with the people, is there boundless joy.

552
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,940
Students,
[Tianjin Nankai Middle School auditorium]

553
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,700
I read
[Tianjin Nankai Middle School auditorium]

554
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,580
this newly published "Youth Magazine"

555
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,540
and was immediately attracted by the

556
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,660
inaugural address "A Call to Youth" by Mr.Chen Duxiu.
[Zhou Enlai, styled Xiang Yu, Nankai School Student]

557
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,700
It was like a bright lamp

558
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,980
that illuminated my mind,

559
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,380
It made me feel like

560
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,780
everything I've thought and learned and done before

561
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,460
was all for nought.

562
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,100
Therefore, I plan to switch

563
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,500
my oral reading

564
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,180
with this issue of "Youth Magazine"

565
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,100
to share my delight with everyone.

566
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,060
Compariots desiring to leave the age of ignorance,

567
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,340
ashamed of their simple mindedness,

568
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,220
and eager to catch up,

569
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,980
must pay equal attention to scientific knowledge and human rights.

570
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,620
Our scholars do not know science.

571
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,940
So they follow the Naturalists' School of auspicious signs and five elements.

572
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,140
Confusing the world and cheating the people.

573
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,140
Our farmers do not know science.

574
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,140
So they have no methods for seed selection or insecticide.

575
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,740
Our industrialists do not know science.

576
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,740
So goods lie wasted on the ground,

577
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,140
as we are dependent on foreign countries.

578
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,900
Our merchants do not know science.

579
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,260
So they only care about short term profits,

580
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,300
without any thought for planning for the future.

581
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,940
Our physicians do not know science.

582
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,540
So they are not acquainted with human anatomy.

583
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,380
The truth

584
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,660
in the universe is boundless.

585
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,980
The fertile realms of science awaiting the trailblazer

586
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,260
are immense!

587
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,580
Youth, take up the task!

588
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,540
[Shanghai]

589
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,180
Strike your little gong.

590
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,540
"Youth Magazine" has been published.

591
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,940
Chinese society has many difficulties.

592
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,380
Mr. Chen Duxiu has shared two prescriptions with the public.

593
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,860
Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science

594
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,260
has already come to China.

595
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,860
King of steel, Carnegie.

596
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,620
That's Carnegie, not Shmarnegie.

597
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,980
Wonderful! Wonderful!

598
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:20,540
Turns out he was originally just a working boy.

599
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,260
Great!

600
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,340
Hello, excuse me.

601
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,060
Take a look, take a peek.

602
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,260
"Youth Magazine"

603
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,700
Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science are here.

604
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,140
See how Carnegie fulfilled the American Dream.

605
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,840
How he went from a worker to the king of steel!

606
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,700
Here, take a look.

607
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:47,660
"Youth Magazine" Come, take a look.
Newest edition.

608
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,500
Take a look.

609
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,660
Together?

610
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,820
Thank you, thank you.

611
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,020
"Youth Magazine"

612
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,700
He's from my hometown.

613
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,740
His name is Hu Shi.

614
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,740
When he was nineteen years old

615
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,220
he went to study abroad in the US,

616
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,020
first at Cornell University to study agricultural science,

617
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,260
then he switched his major to literature.

618
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,740
He went to Columbia University this year

619
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,300
to study with that well-known professor, John Dewey,

620
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,540
for a doctorate of philosophy.

621
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,140
It can be said that this child

622
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,860
is proficient in literature, history, and philosophy.

623
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,660
He saw an issue of our "Youth Magazine"
[Yi Baisha, styled Yue Cun, New Culture Movement activist]

624
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,900
and was very excited.

625
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,460
He's sent a letter

626
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,360
and wants to write an article regarding the revolution in literature.

627
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,460
So I would like to solicit your opinions.

628
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,620
That's great!

629
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,020
This topic of literary revolution is great.

630
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,100
I really didn't expect

631
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,620
a student who has been overseas for years

632
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,400
to be capable of seeing the purpose of my magazine

633
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,180
so incisively.

634
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,620
Genius!

635
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,980
A kindred spirit!

636
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,380
Alright, Zhong Fu

637
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,180
A sworn friend!

638
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,460
That's enough.

639
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,060
Zhong Fu, a young man's letter

640
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,460
can get you so excited?

641
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,500
Aren't you too ridiculous?

642
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,780
Not by half!

643
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,140
Ideological guidance cannot be idle chit-chat,

644
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,420
but start from a concrete basis

645
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,940
that focuses on the lives of the masses.

646
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,700
"Literary Revolution: A Tentative Proposal"

647
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,700
If this article is written properly,

648
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,500
it will be a bombshell!

649
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,820
Bai Sha, the younger generation will in time surpass us!

650
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,740
This Hu Shi

651
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,580
is too important for our "Youth Magazine."

652
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,580
Must grab him!

653
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,580
Oh Zhong Fu,

654
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:20,940
in this time and age,

655
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,180
it's not easy to find a genius

656
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,380
who can catch your eye.

657
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,020
Though don't get too hung up on it.

658
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,740
This guy is a doctoral student in the United States,

659
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,580
and a disciple of Professor Dewey.

660
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,380
As if you can grab him just by saying so.

661
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,740
This guy lives in the United States.

662
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,340
Whether he can even come back is an issue.

663
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,940
No, no. This I can guarantee.

664
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,300
He will definitely return to China after completing his studies.

665
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,980
How can one be sure?

666
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,620
This guy, Hu Shi,

667
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,180
is a filial son.

668
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,900
Before he went abroad to study,

669
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,900
his mother arranged a marriage for him.

670
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,060
His mother can't wait to get a grandson.

671
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,700
So she writes him letters every few days

672
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,580
telling him to come back after he finishes his studies to get married.

673
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,340
He would not dare to disobey his mother.

674
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,260
This person is really too wonderful.

675
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,460
His thinking is wonderful.

676
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,140
What?

677
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:07,880
Grab him!

678
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,580
Grab him as soon as he comes back.

679
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,220
Junman!

680
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,860
Here, let me.

681
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,060
Why is your cough so bad?

682
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,860
You took your medicine?

683
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,660
I did. It's not effective.

684
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,020
It's not effective?

685
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,060
You have to keep taking it.

686
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,540
How can the medicine work if you don't keep taking it?

687
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,340
I've finished it.

688
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,780
But there were no results.

689
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,860
You've finished it.

690
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,980
Ok, alright.

691
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,300
Don't work any more.

692
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,340
Go rest in the house.

693
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,660
Let me sit here for a bit.

694
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,340
Get some air.

695
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,700
Then wait. I will go buy medicine.

696
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,580
You don't need to go.

697
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,940
The drawer has long run out of money.

698
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,740
The money you gave me last month is all used up.

699
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,260
It's an old problem.

700
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,260
It'll pass.

701
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,340
Don't worry. I'm not dying.

702
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,340
Gao Junman!

703
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,900
Don't work anymore!

704
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,140
No one's dying if the firewood's not chopped.

705
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,300
Go inside and rest.

706
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,140
Wait for me.

707
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,140
No one's dying if the firewood's not chopped.

708
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,660
Can't cook if the firewood's not chopped!

709
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,220
Zhong Fu,

710
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,060
why are you here in such a heavy rain?

711
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,220
Just dropping by.

712
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,220
Pour your own tea if you want.

713
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,140
Those the accounts?

714
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,420
So today,

715
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,940
I ran around to collect the money.

716
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,380
To date, our "Youth Magazine"

717
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,420
has sold 2000 copies in total,

718
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,380
breaking even.

719
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,540
The principal has basically been recouped.

720
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,580
That's great.

721
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,620
That's a good thing, right?

722
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,860
Mengzou,

723
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,300
My uh...

724
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,020
This issue's payment for uh,

725
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,020
for my editorial.

726
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,180
Is that included in the capital?

727
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,620
I'm calculating the big accounts.

728
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,860
Haven't had a chance yet to take you into consideration.

729
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,340
Hold on, you have to take me into consideration as well.

730
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,060
If your capital has been recouped

731
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,780
then shouldn't the payment for my editorial

732
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,460
be given back to me?

733
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,940
Alright, then let me take you into consideration right now.

734
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,980
Let me see,

735
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,580
Your manuscript fee, editorial fee

736
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,460
added together

737
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,380
is 138 silver dollars.

738
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,140
However, you've asked three times for an advance.

739
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,100
The first time, for 4 silver dollars.

740
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,060
The second time, also for 4 silver dollars.

741
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,220
The third time, for 10 silver dollars.

742
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,900
18 all together.

743
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,100
138 minus 18

744
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,100
So you should get

745
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,540
120 silver dollars, correct?

746
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,420
I'll give it to you right now.

747
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,380
Fifty.

748
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,380
One hundred.

749
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,140
One twenty.

750
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,140
Take it.

751
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,220
I borrowed money three times.

752
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,140
Two $4 and one $10.

753
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,780
Why don't I have any impression of this?

754
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,860
These matters, you don't need to think over it.

755
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,380
These are the matters I'll look after.

756
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,580
As for you, great thinker

757
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,100
just unhesitatingly let out your brilliance.

758
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,060
Zhong Fu,

759
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,060
you say, this Yuan Shikai,

760
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,060
his determination to be the emperor

761
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,460
makes the heavens angry and causes people to resent.

762
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,220
This authority, right now also has no time

763
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,660
to deal with the revolutionaries.

764
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,580
As soon as the current political situation starts to ease

765
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,900
this business opportunity, it will come.

766
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,620
I want to seize onto the opportunity, go out and raise capital.

767
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,980
With your great persona, you will have a lot of acquaintances.

768
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,060
Bring over more people with money to invest.

769
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,580
This magazine of ours, maybe it will resume operations.

770
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,220
Alright. No problem.

771
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,540
You're responsible for finding people, I'll show up personally.

772
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,980
As long as the magazine can be managed well,

773
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,100
whatever you have me do is fine.

774
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,620
Uncle Wang.

775
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,340
You've come back.

776
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,940
Dad.

777
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,340
Why have you come back so early today?

778
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,940
It's raining today, impossible to work.

779
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,580
Mengzou

780
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,140
This... Yannian and Qiaonian doing editing here,

781
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,140
isn't it that they should have pay too?

782
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,460
I gave it to them, Yannian didn't want it.

783
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,220
Speaking about this pay,

784
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,940
it's made up for in my accommodation fees here.

785
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,860
I want to properly discuss with you,

786
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,260
these two children's matters.

787
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,460
In the daytime, they are working at the port.

788
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,460
At night, they come over to my place to be editors.

789
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,180
And they still need to learn French.

790
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,100
Wouldn't you say these two children are too tired

791
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:08,420
That is to say, the two brothers living costs right now,

792
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,700
all depends on the salary from working at the port.

793
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,940
That's right.

794
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,260
I have also heard, at the port they

795
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,060
extended the working time.

796
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,860
I quietly asked Qiaonian

797
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,260
what's going on?

798
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,580
He said it's for getting the tuition to learn French.

799
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,340
You say, what to do?

800
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,260
This child, right now

801
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,140
when his body is still growing.

802
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,540
If he's like this, wouldn't his body break down?

803
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,180
You say, what to do with this?

804
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,780
Those two, if they didn't want the editing pay,

805
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,500
you should give it me.

806
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,420
I am his father.

807
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,340
It should be me... Receiving it...

808
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,020
It should be normal too, right?

809
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,220
What! This is...

810
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,980
That's another matter!

811
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,980
Didn't I already tell you?

812
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,900
Yannian had the pay

813
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,220
included it in the accommodation fees here.

814
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,780
You still say your son and you are very similar,

815
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,340
not even a little similar.

816
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,980
He, give him money and he doesn't want it.

817
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,020
You here, keep going on and on with me.

818
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,300
This is 50 silver dollars.

819
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,860
100 silver dollars.

820
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:29,780
This is 20.

821
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,740
Dad, what are you giving me so much..

822
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,700
Listen to me.

823
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,580
This money, I give it to you two brothers to pay tuition.

824
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,900
Understand?

825
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,260
Quickly go.

826
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,420
Zhong Fu.

827
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,620
You already gave it.

828
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,900
Mengzou.

829
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,500
You say, just now

830
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,900
said something like I borrowed money three times.

831
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,940
$4 twice, $10 once.

832
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,260
When was that?

833
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,020
How come I don't have any impression.

834
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,740
Let me look at the account.

835
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,860
Don't talk about these things with me anymore.

836
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,860
I'll draw some money for you again,

837
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,100
not for drawing some money for myself.

838
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,580
I'll look at the account. How come I didn't...

839
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:14,780
Stop there!

840
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,340
Chen Yannian!

841
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,500
This money is to give you two brothers to pay tuition.

842
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,500
Am I wrong?

843
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,500
Don't need it.

844
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,060
Today, you say it to me clearly.

845
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,180
What is it about me that you are so against?

846
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,540
You are too greedy.

847
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:40,420
You want both a family and to love your country.

848
00:35:38,426 --> 00:35:40,369
I do want both a family and to love my country.

849
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,660
Is there a contradiction between these two?

850
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,780
There is a contradiction.

851
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,860
If you want to love your country, then you must give up the family.

852
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,260
Otherwise, you will only give the family

853
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,580
an even greater harm.

854
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,580
You really feel your assertion has value?

855
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,100
At least, currently, yes.

856
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,820
Good! Then you keep insisting!

857
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,740
Go! Go!

858
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,220
Yannian. Yannian!

859
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,300
Zhong Fu!

860
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,140
Being older, wants to chat

861
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,180
but it collapses with a single conversation.

862
00:36:19,883 --> 00:36:23,299
[Waseda University dormitory, Japan]

863
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,060
Shou Chang

864
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,860
Did you see the announcement at the school's entrance?

865
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,500
The school is known for its long-standing lack of learning.

866
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,180
You have been expelled!

867
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,620
I saw it. This was within my expectations.

868
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,580
I've been struggling for months.

869
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,940
It's done now. I've got a result.

870
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,700
I can completely focus on taking care of the revolution now.

871
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,580
Brother Shouchang

872
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,100
It's completely me who harmed you

873
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,660
At that time, I really shouldn't have insisted on pulling you

874
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,340
to be the editor-in-chief of "Minyi" magazine.

875
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,940
You were originally at the Foreign Students Assocation in Japan

876
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,660
being the head editor in the literature and history committee

877
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,780
were already very busy.

878
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,060
It doesn't have to do with you.

879
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,900
It's I who likes to edit magazines.

880
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,740
Right now, Yuan Shikai acts an emperor.

881
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,900
The country is already successfully thrown into a complete mess.

882
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,220
I absolutely can not calm down my heart to read books.

883
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,460
What plans do you have?

884
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,620
First, wholeheartedly

885
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,500
edit the first issue of "Minyi" magazine

886
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,340
have it become the rallying cry that denounces Yuan Shikai.

887
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,140
Then, I'll return to the country. Head to the battlefield.

888
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,180
Listening to you like this, I also can't sit still.

889
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,740
Anyway, I am also graduating soon

890
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,340
When the time comes, I'll return with you.

891
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,780
but returning to the main topic,

892
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,380
if we're really going to the firing line to fire guns and battle.

893
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,980
I don't know if I can do it.

894
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,660
Who says you have to fight Yuan with real weapons?

895
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,700
Chen Duxiu's ideological enlightenment of the youth

896
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,860
was the same as the Yuan struggle.

897
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,380
Moreover, he did it from the roots.

898
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,340
It's not bad compared to the results of a firearm.

899
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,100
Shouchang, I heard that his magazine

900
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,420
ran into big trouble.

901
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,820
Already stopped publishing.

902
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,900
I know.

903
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,260
Small trouble. It's almost resolved.

904
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,580
Just change the publication name, and it's fine.

905
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,700
Right now, I am in the middle of

906
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,420
writing an article for the relaunch issue.

907
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,220
You are? Can I take a look?

908
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,300
What a great title for "Youth".

909
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,860
This long?

910
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,700
I'll read it to you. You try to feel it.

911
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,540
Yes, yes.

912
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,940
When the Earth turns white,

913
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,500
we are still in our youth.

914
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,140
We use our youth,

915
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,820
To softly change earth's whiteness.

916
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,780
Although old, yet not old

917
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,540
is the Earth's one day of existence.

918
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:38,164
That is, our youth exists for one day.

919
00:38:39,054 --> 00:38:41,840
Our youth exists for one day.

920
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,654
That is, the youth of the earth exists for one day.

921
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,900
In 1916,

922
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,460
Li Dazhao wrote his famous article

923
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,660
"Youth", in Japan.

924
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,460
The article used an uplifting revolutionary spirit

925
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,260
and a scientific approach to humanism

926
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,660
expressing an clear materialistic ideology,

927
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,940
proposing the ideal of rejuvenating China's youth.

928
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,340
Calling young people

929
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,300
to break through the snares of past history,

930
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,140
destroy stereotypical doctrines,

931
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,740
use the spirit of youth to continuously transform oneself,

932
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,940
use the vitality of youth, the ideals of youth

933
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,980
to wake up the old China from the century of dormancy,

934
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,140
and establish a youthful China.

935
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,620
Hurry, hurry, hurry. It's freezing.

936
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:40,606
[First-rate Xiang hotel, Shanghai]

937
00:39:40,606 --> 00:39:44,401
[Wu Zhihui a.k.a. Jing Heng]

938
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,780
Hurry, come warm up in the fire.

939
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,620
Quickly sit, quickly sit. Warm up.

940
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,260
Knowing I came back,

941
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,740
you guys even came to see me. Good!

942
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,660
By contrast, your guys' father

943
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,740
don't know if he doesn't welcome me back.

944
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,460
Or he is scared that I will snatch his profits,

945
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,100
so he's pulling his strong card with me

946
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,420
It's already been so long, and he doesn't come to see me,

947
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,260
he is really worse than a child.

948
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,980
What is Chen Duxiu busy with?

949
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,700
"Youth Magazine" became renowned with other people.

950
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,420
It was sued by others for breach of reputation

951
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,420
and so stopped publishing.

952
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,980
He's been busy with the lawsuit.

953
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,500
Who is so insensitive?

954
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,980
Dare to dispute with the enlightened great master Chen Duxiu?

955
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,740
Isn't this finding trouble by yourself?

956
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,780
Okay, okay. Let's not talk about him now.

957
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,660
How are you guys doing?

958
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,260
Living, isn't it very tough?

959
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,980
We aren't afraid of hardship!

960
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,500
We two have been working while studying.

961
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,780
Living life to the fullest!

962
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,180
Good. Good.

963
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,660
I didn't misjudge you guys.

964
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,740
I'll tell you guys.

965
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,300
I returned this time,

966
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,700
first is to assist in overthrowing the Lord Protector Yuan,

967
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,940
second is to launch a campaign for a work-study program for those who will stay in France.

968
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,220
Didn't you guys want to go to France?

969
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,620
Let me test you guys.

970
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,940
Nowadays, what is the most popular theory in the West?

971
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,700
Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution!

972
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,540
That's not simple,

973
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:56,780
who told you this?

974
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,980
I overheard it too

975
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,460
Hunan and Anhui comrades held a meeting.

976
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,340
Chen Duxiu gave everyone

977
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,780
an explanation on the Theory of Evolution all morning

978
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,460
saying that natural selection is an unchanging truth

979
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,260
and is the motivation for human progress

980
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,780
In this, Chen Duxiu is ignorant and narrow-minded.

981
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,500
He only knows the first thing and not the second.

982
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,500
Actually, the popular theory nowadays

983
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,540
is not Darwin's Theory of Evolution,

984
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,540
rather it's Kropotkin's Theory of Mutual Assistance.

985
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,620
Come.

986
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,380
This is some material from France that I specially

987
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,420
brought back for you guys.

988
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,460
You guys carefully take a look at it.

989
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:30,900
I guarantee

990
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,500
as you guys understand it more and more,

991
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,980
you will for sure deeply fall in love with it.

992
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,780
Take a look, take a look.

993
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,100
March 1916

994
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,220
amidst the outcry at home and abroad

995
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,580
Yuan Shikai was forced to cancel his autocratic monarchy.

996
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,780
A shameful performance full of a farce to restore an autocratic monarchy

997
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,900
came to a premature end.

998
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,660
Since the Xinhai Revolution,

999
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,100
due to the fact that in China

1000
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,100
the idea to establish a bourgeois republic

1001
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,300
was out of step with the Chinese situation,

1002
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,580
the old democratic revolution

1003
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,620
lead by China's bourgeoisie

1004
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,580
cannot obtain the extensive support of the working class.

1005
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,700
Hitting a wall in all directions. Suffering defeat in every battle.

1006
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,300
A difficult situation.

1007
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,660
Yuan Shikai, who represents the feudal power of China

1008
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,980
was regarded as taking away the achievements of the Xinhai Revolution, and met with contempt after his death.

1009
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:20,180
Revolutionists who were forced into exile overseas returned to the country one after another

1010
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,980
Li Dazhao

1011
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,380
invited to visit Beijing

1012
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,460
took the post of editor-in-chief of "Morning Bell" newspaper.

1013
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,340
At this time, after the baptism of the anti-Yuan movement

1014
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,380
initially accepting

1015
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,580
the historical materialism point of view, Li Dazhao

1016
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:36,660
already became a revolutionary full of new ideas.

[Qianmen Street, Beijing]

1018
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,860
Brother. Where is your home?

1019
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,420
Outside Yongdingmen. The pariah.

1020
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,100
Why do you say this?

1021
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,900
Those who pull carts, wield skill in trade

1022
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,180
have shaved heads, are pig butchers, coffin carriers,

1023
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,420
all live over there.

1024
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,700
Then how is getting by in life right now for you guys?

1025
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,860
Impossible to get by. Everyone's suffering until they can't take it anymore.

1026
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,780
According to the older generations' saying,

1027
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,460
we have never gone through such sullen days.
