[Episode Five]

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,456
The roots of popularising science and democracy

4
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,080
lie in education.

5
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,776
If you, Cai Yuanpei,

6
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,376
can use the treasure of Peking University to reform and innovate

7
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,456
in order to revive our Chinese nation,

8
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,320
you will have our support and hope.

9
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,096
The words of Brother Botang

10
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,256
are exactly what I, Cai Yuanpei, want.

11
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,816
Okay, I'm going to reply to Li Yuanhong

12
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,080
to take up his post at Peking University as soon as possible.

13
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,456
Hold on, Brother Jiemin.

14
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,376
If you want this job, you have to do it right.

15
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,536
Without water, it's hard to build a canal.

16
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,376
If you want to be in this hornet's nest of Peking University,

17
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,376
and make a career out of it.

18
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,880
It's going to take a lot of work!

19
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,616
Please teach me, Brother Botang.

20
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,136
I know you have a well-developed idea

21
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,456
of how to revolutionize education,

22
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,936
but in order to achieve your ambition,

23
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,376
you have to meet the conditions set by Li Yuanhong:

24
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,976
sufficient funds,

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,416
abundance of talented people,

26
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,856
transfer of power to lower level.

27
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,376
Without these three demands,

28
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,640
no matter how good your plans are

29
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,136
as the old Beijing saying goes

30
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,760
it will be "a blind waste of time".

31
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,960
With Brother Botang's help, I, Yuanpei,

32
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,785
am certain to become the president of Peking University.

33
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:09,799
Good.

34
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,680
Excellent, excellent!

The young are promising!

38

This Hu Shizhi fired eight bombshells at once,

39
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,496
each hitting the lifeblood of old literature.

40
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,856
Baisha, hurry up and arrange

41
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,840
the official 1917 New Year's publication

{\an8}[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, editor-in-chief of "New Youth"]

as a New Year's gift.

46
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,016
Zhongfu, take it easy, don't rush.

47
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,216
Didn't we agree?

48
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,936
The first issue will publish Hu Shi's eight vernacular poems.

49
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,776
You can't make it a special issue.

50
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,896
Besides, he's a nobody,

51
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,736
few people in China know him.

52
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,296
If he does not sell, we can not afford the loss.

53
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,336
Put the vernacular poem further back.

54
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,200
This article "A Preliminary Discussion of Language Reform" is more influential.

55
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,376
Wait, why has it changed to "Reform?"

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,656
Isn't it a revolution?

57
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,256
This carries a lot less weight.

58
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,936
Is this kid scared?

59
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,616
It's understandable that young people have their worries.

60
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,216
If he wants "Reform" so be it.

61
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,616
I'll write him an editor's note on this one,

62
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,336
and I'll write the "On Literary Revolution" on the next one.

63
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,336
Yes, the New Culture Movement's

64
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,296
flag-bearer

65
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,936
should be a famous person like you, Chen Zhongfu.

66
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,856
It's enough for the younger generation

67
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,456
to just lead the charge.

68
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,416
Mengzou.

69
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,936
This "New Youth" is becoming more and more influential

70
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,456
and the distribution must keep up.

71
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,776
Especially in schools and in some big cities

72
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,776
that have to become our main battlefield.

73
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,176
I was just about to discuss the prospectus with you.

74
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,936
Beijing has a lot of cultural businessmen,

75
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,696
who are very optimistic about "New Youth".

76
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,696
and about you, Chen Duxiu,

77
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,616
and they all wanted to actively invest in the venture.

78
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,136
We must go to Beijing in the near future.

79
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,216
Good, I'd love to check it out.

80
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,376
If the New Culture Movement is not active in Beijing,

81
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,896
could it be even called a movement?

82
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,616
If no one in Beijing shows up to support "New Youth",

83
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,896
does it have any influence?

84
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,256
I think this can not be delayed.

85
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,444
Next week, next week we will leave.

86
00:04:45,468 --> 00:04:46,039
Next week?

87
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,336
Next week.

88
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,880
Alright, alright.

89
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,424
"New Youth"!

90
00:05:06,424 --> 00:05:09,404

98
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:24,998
Read the newly published "New Youth"!

99

Newly published "New Youth"!

100
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,440
You go back first.

101
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,816
What does this mean?

102
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,056
Count it. Two dollars and eighty-six cents.

103
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,360
We dried out the magazines.

104
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,696
No need for this.

105
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,536
You still don't want?

106
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,576
How about this?

107
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,200
Count me in to buy thirteen of your magazines.

108
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,376
Sold.

109
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,416
Qiaonian.

110
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,736
Wrap thirteen magazines for this sister.

111
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,720
That's right!

112
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,816
Actually I had a big fight with my dad

113
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,576
that day at home.

114
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,376
When I got up in the morning,

115
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,976
there was no one at home.

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,536
I was late when no one asked me to go to school.

117
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,856
So I was in a bad mood that day.

118
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,376
My attitude was naturally bad.

119
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,000
So I kicked you all out in a rage.

120
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,536
Don't take it personally.

121
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,736
We made mistakes before

122
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,336
not knowing the school rules.

123
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,416
I also changed your bucket of water.

124
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,856
We both apologize to you.

125
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,199
Don't take it to heart.

126
00:06:42,223 --> 00:06:43,176
Don't take it to heart.

127
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,456
Then we will not take it to heart.

128
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,527
We're even.

129
00:06:45,551 --> 00:06:47,381
Even.

130
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,856
So what you are saying is

131
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,616
you would like me to go to America with Liu Mei.

132
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,600
Correct.

133
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,136
And for your brother,

134
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,896
if you agree,

135
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,656
I'll ask Mr. Wu Zhihui

136
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,536
to apply for your quotas in the Ministry of Education.

137
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,336
But we can't accept other people's funding.

138
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,696
You misunderstood this.

139
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,936
I'm not trying to fund you.

140
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,416
I want you to do me a favor.

141
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,496
Liu Mei is my only daughter.

142
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,256
She is still young now

143
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,416
and has poor ability to live independently.

144
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,296
If she goes to study alone,

145
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,056
I won't feel at ease.

146
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,416
But if you go with her,

147
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,896
you will take care of each other.

148
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,496
I'll be relieved.

149
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,896
And as far as the current situation is concerned,

150
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,416
studying in the United States is the best choice.

151
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,616
This is for you both,

152
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,496
I think, a good thing.

153
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,976
Uncle, I have my own principles.

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,600
We cannot accept this kindness of yours.

155
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,760
Farewell for now.

Don't answer me so hastily.

159
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,856
You have to think about it.

160
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,216
But remember,

161
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,296
this road I've paved for you,

162
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,456
it is definitely wide,

163
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,376
it is definitely flat,

164
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,656
it is definitely full of sunlight.

165
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,640
Uncle.

166
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,496
I can reply to you now.

167
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,600
We will walk our own road.

I wouldn't have been able to come back to Beijing.

Don't get drunk later and delay business.

OK, then let's get down to business.

183

Brother Jiemin, Li Yuanhong has made up his mind

184
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,656
to invite you to join Peking University.

185

Six hundred dollars a month.

What do you think? When will you take office?

187
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,336

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,736
To tell the truth,

197
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,296
I've repeatedly weighted the pros and cons before coming

198
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,456
and listened to the views of many people.

199
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,896
The fact I am in Beijing should make my true feelings self-evident.

200
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,056
I don't need to say too many of these polite words.

201
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,216
It's that, Jingsheng,

202
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,456
if President Li approves of my prelminary agreement,

203
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,816
then I'll be the president of Peking University.

204
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,160
Brother, please tell me about your rules.

205
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,176
This is my entire vision.

206

Please let me show it to you.

Brother Jiemin.

208
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,296
Well, this precedent you're setting is a bit too ambitious.

209
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,816
What's wrong, Jingsheng?

210
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,896
It scares the hell out of you?

211
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,576
And this is just my initial vision for the school.

212
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,296
The second planning scheme of the school...

213
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,496
Wait, wait, wait.

214
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,816
Brother Jiemin, just the first stage, recruiting talent...

215
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,936
You want to, from at home and abroad,

216
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,496
recruit a hundred professors.

217
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,176
Arts and sciences director, monthly salary of three hundred silver dollars.

218
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,776
Other professors range from one hundred and twenty to two hundred and eighty.

219
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,576
How much does it cost to pay the head fee for a year?

220
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,536
It is equivalent to dozens of times the current Peking University.

221
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,096
You're demanding a pound of flesh from President Li.

Jingsheng, national modernisation

223
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,136
must be education-oriented.

224
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,456
This is a prerequisite for financial security,

225
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,216
You did not recall me to the country

226
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,856
to Peking University to be a business-as-usual president.

227
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,520
Is this the original intention of President Li?

228
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,016
Such a big country

229
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,656
would not be short of this funding for Peking University, would it?

231

just talk to President Li.

Come on, come on. Sit, sit, sit.

299

Two plates of lamb, one plate of tripe,

300

chinese cabbage, frozen tofu,

301
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,496
rice noodles, sugar and garlic.

That's right.

This old Beijing lamb.

310
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,816
This seasoning is the most delicate.

311
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,616
Sesame sauce, soy beans, curd chives.

312
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,816
All essential.

313
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,240
And scallions, coriander and chili oil.

314
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,680
You have to mix it up.

315
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,976
This lamb also has an art to it.

316
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,920
For the tripe, you can't leave the chopsticks still.

317
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,576
Just seven or eight strokes is enough.

318
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,200
Seven, seven...

319
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,336
If you don't do that, it'll be overdone.

320
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,320
Too tough to eat.

321
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,136

into the broth.

326
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,696
Take care!

327
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,896

One more!

330
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,776
This is the old Beijing way of eating.

331
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,616
The method that you talked about,

332
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,376
was invented by you

333
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,600
pedantic literary people.

334
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,616
Who invented it?

335
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,896
We've gained some real first-hand experience.

336
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,480
It's a guest!

337
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,016
Boss!

338
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,656
Interesting.

339
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,320
It's okay!

340
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,600
Come!

341
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,056
Junior!

342
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,016
Come!

343
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,056
Two seats?

344
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,536
Two seats, two seats.

345
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,976
Okay, please come inside. Come, come, come. This way.

346
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,496
They are still eating.

347
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,136
Alright, alright.

348
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,176
This way!

349
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,840
Good.

350
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,856
Xingang!

351
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,557
Mr. Zhongfu!

352
00:16:06,557 --> 00:16:07,576
Hello sir.

353
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,376
What a coincidence!

354
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,736
Why are you in Beijing?

355
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,016
After Shanghai,

356
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,776
we both came to Beijing to study.

357
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,760
Sit down. Sit down.

358
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,496
She had just passed the Peking University entrance exam,

359
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,336
But now Peking University doesn't accept female students.

360
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,416
So Bailan worked as a tutor in Dongjiaominxiang

361
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,696
tutoring French at the same time,

362
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,936
to work and study in France in the future.

363
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,856
Today, she just got paid.

364
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,536
The two of us planned to come here to have a nice meal.

365
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,456
I didn't expect to meet you, sir.

366
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,896
What a coincidence!

367
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,176
You are at Peking University now.

368
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,416
I wanted a chance to visit Peking University anyway.

369
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,016
You can show me around when you have time.

370
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,976
Of course, sir.

371
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,696
You don't know it,

372
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,456
but you're a celebrity at Peking University.

373
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,656
Many students and teachers are all reading

374
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,336
that "New Youth" magazine you founded.

375
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,400
So admirable!

376
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,536
Server!

377
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:46,856
Coming!

378
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,216
Remove the hotpot separator.

379
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,496
We'll eat from the same pot.

380
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,056
Sure.

381
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,816
And add another two plates of mutton.

382
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,480
Will do.

383
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,416
Anyone can tell at a glance that you're birds of a feather,

384
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,576
dipping your food next to each other.

385
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,856
Have a nice meal.

386
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,576
Yes.

387
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,296
Here, eat.

388
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,016
Go ahead, eat.

389
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,080
Thank you, sir.

390
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,640
Eat.

391
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,896
Zhongfu,

392
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,360
You've frightened the kids.

393
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,496
Mr. Zhongfu,

394
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,880
have you not eaten for several days?

395
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,856
This is a method I've just learned from the labouring masses.

396
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,000
It's exceptionally delightful.

397
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,440
An absolute delight!

398
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,776
Hurry up and eat. Gotta pick up a fare.

399
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,816
What fare?

400
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,336
Are you pulling a rickshaw?

401
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,656
Pulling in investors! Hurry.

402
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,240
Alright!

403
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,616
Brother Jiemin,

404
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,840
from today on, you will be the principal of Peking University.

405
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,776
Master Cai,

406
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,216
this is a heavy responsibility to shoulder.

407
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,120
Please.

408
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,360
Jingsheng, this is hard to come by.

409
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,360
I will cherish it.

410
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,800
I thank everyone for their help.

411
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,720
I, Yuanpei, will certainly fulfill the mission.

412
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,936
Master Cai, when do you plan to assume office?

413
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,416
And where will you start?

414
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,576
It is for you to decide when.

415
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,016
And as for where to start,

416
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,696
I think the first step

417
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,296
is to recruit talent.

418
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,376
First of all, those from the liberal arts.

419
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,816
I would like to find someone

420
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,176
who can raise the banner of innovation to be the dean of liberal arts.

421
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,776
Everyone present, please help me think

422
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,176
who is able to take on this important task.

423
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,880
This liberal arts dean

424
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,936
must be sympathetic to you,

425
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,776
but also be of noble character and high prestige.

426
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,696
Must be a learned academic,

427
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,256
but also with the ability to charge through enemy lines.

428
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,256
Such a person is not easy to find.

429
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,176
I've thought of someone.

430
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,216
Chen Zhongfu, or Chen Duxiu.

431
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,296
This is a person who is leading the trends of today's China.

432
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,496
He is certain to be able to take on this important task.

433
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,960
I also thought of Chen Duxiu.

434
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,416
Are you know Chen Duxiu well?

435
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,856
Only as an acquaintance.

436
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,936
But I've read every issue

437
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,696
of his magazine "New Youth."

438
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,136
Yes, his magazine "New Youth."

439
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,960
I also read it.

440
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,936
Brother Zhongfu and I are old friends.

441
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,456
Qian Xuantong said that

442
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,056
Chen Duxiu has come to Beijing.

443
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,160
He's asked for a meeting to commission an article.

444
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,336
Where is he living? Do you know?

445
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,296
I will ask around.

446
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,640
Yes. Please.

447
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,536
Zhongfu, listen to me. Zhongfu.

448
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,040
That's one hundred thousand shares acquired in one go.

449
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,480
Zhongfu.

450
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,600
It's great. Several hundred thousand shares.

451
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,856
We've done it this time.

452
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,336
This time, we can go all out.

453
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,536
It seems like in Beijing our "New Youth"

454
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,416
has a lot of influence.

455
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:45,976
That's for sure.

456
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,936
Huge potential market.

457
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,136
Definitely.

458
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,936
Now I believe the words you spoke last year.

459
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,976
Which words?

460
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,976
You said, give you ten years.

461
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And you will change the thinking of our compatriots.

462
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,760
Now it looks like it won't take ten years.

463
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,576
We must set up a banquet.

464
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,456
To celebrate.

465
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:04,936
Yes.

466
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,696
I will ask Xingang and Bailan to come.

467
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,176
Quickly.

468
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,520
Yes.

469
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,736
Dropped a seed and sprouted a shoot.

470
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,496
What branch, what leaf, what flower will bloom?

471
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,480
Bear what kind of fruit? Grind -

472
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,560
Brother Jiemin.

473
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,800
Brother Zhongfu.

474
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,496
How did you find me here?

475
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,800
I will always be able to find you.

476
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,800
Come this way, sir.

477
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,616
Please come inside.

478
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,520
In here.

479
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,176
Please sit, sir.

480
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,360
Alright. Please sit.

481
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,776
Have a seat.

482
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,840
Yes.

483
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,016
Sir, sit.

484
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,080
Brother Zhongfu.

485
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,360
I have the impression...

486
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,056
that I am a few years your senior.

487
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,656
I was born in the year of the rabbit，

488
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,136
in the fifth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu (1879)

489
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,976
We have the same zodiac sign.

490
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,296
I was born in the sixth year of the reign of Emperor Tongzhi. (1867)

491
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,120
You see, I remembered I am a cycle older than you.

492
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,656
Do you still remember when we were in Shanghai twenty years ago?

493
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,136
Together on an assassination squad,

494
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,896
prototyping a bomb?

495
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,816
How could I forget?

496
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,536
Couldn't manufacture it, narrowly escaped with our lives.

497
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,080
Even now, I often see it in my dreams.

498
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,416
True, true.

499
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,296
At the time, if you hadn't given that shove...

500
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,936
I would not be sitting in front of you today.

501
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,176
Dead as a doornail, long ago.

502
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,616
Brother Zhongfu,

503
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,856
you saved my life.

504
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,536
I have to properly thank you.

505
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,160
You're too kind. You're overstating it.

506
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,256
Twelve years ago,

507
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,360
I was the age you are now.

508
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,576
At that time,

509
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,056
there was nothing I was afraid of doing, nothing I was afraid of saying.

510
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,136
I was brave and unyielding.

511
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,136
But now I am old.

512
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,816
No longer have that edge.

513
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,640
And not as driven as times gone by.

514
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,736
You're not doing so bad.

515
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,416
Nowadays, you, Chen Duxiu,

516
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,896
has raised in China the two big banners

517
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,120
of science and democracy.

518
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,656
And what have you brought the country?

519
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,056
A breath of fresh air.

520
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,576
I read every issue of your magazine "New Youth."

521
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,616
With each reading, there's always something to be gained.

522
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,776
Sir, if you would like to submit a manuscript,

523
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,936
I would be extremely grateful.

524
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,240
That is a matter of course. Naturally I will contribute.

525
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,400
I came here today

526
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,736
to ask you for some help.

527
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,640
Please go on, sir.

528
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,976
Starting yesterday, I have been

529
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,480
formally appointed the president of Peking Univesity.

530
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,480
Take a look. Letter of appointment.

531
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,000
Congratulations, sir.

532
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,816
I would like you to come to Peking University to be the Dean of Liberal Arts.

533
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,736
Lend me a hand.

534
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,816
Lend Peking University a hand.

535
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,880
I hope Brother Zhongfu would not decline.

536
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,616
I would like to thank Brother Jiemin for the support.

537
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,456
But this is very sudden.

538
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,080
I'm not mentally prepared.

539
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,736
Zhongfu,

540
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,016
the Dean of Liberal Arts is equivalent to the Deputy President of Peking University,

541
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,536
leading the various disciplines of the humanities and social science.

542
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,056
Aren't you currently advocating and calling for

543
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,216
democratic science?

544
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,400
I think this would be your best stage to do so.

545
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,096
Precisely because it's a serious responsibility,

546
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,440
I don't want to rashly accept an appointment.

547
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,496
After all, I haven't properly gone to university.

548
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,616
And have no experience teaching or educating others.

549
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,896
An incompetent person who pretends to be competent

550
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,576
will only hinder the progress of their students.

551
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,616
If I actually got in the way of your grand undertaking,

552
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,856
there would be no greater crime.

553
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,176
Don't decline in such a rush.

554
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,296
It's true that this is very abrupt.

555
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,216
You can discuss this at your leisure

556
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,776
with friends and family and then make a decision.

557
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,336
I am indeed eager in my search for talent.

558
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,416
I am determined to invite you

559
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,816
to Peking University and work together.

560
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,200
For China. For education in China.

561
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,776
For Master Cai to show such high regard for me,

562
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,696
I am truly moved to tears.

563
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,736
If Peking University is to become China's highest educational institution,

564
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,616
it will be the best platform to advocate for science and democracy.

565
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,176
If there is an opportunity to follow Brother Jiemin

566
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,376
to Peking University and collaborate on this endeavour,

567
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,400
it would be the blessing of three lifetimes, exactly what I've been looking for.

568
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,376
But to be quite honest,

569
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,176
in my heart,

570
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,216
I can't let go of my "New Youth."

571
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,496
This magazine is still a fledgling

572
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,336
that has just started picking up.

573
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,616
I came to Beijing this time

574
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,976
precisely because of the magazine. Looking for investors and resources.

575
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,256
A successful harvest.

576
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,416
Only just today, I've discussed

577
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,600
an investment of over a hundred thousand shares.

578
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,856
At a time like this,

579
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,616
if I leave "New Youth" behind without a care

580
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,136
to take a position at Peking University,

581
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,736
wouldn't I be letting down

582
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,136
everyone's deep regard?

583
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,656
It's true. I understand.

584
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,416
What you are saying is not without reason.

585
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,456
If the result of you coming to Peking University

586
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,096
is the stoppage of the publication of "New Youth."

587
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,520
That's unacceptable.

588
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,056
Alright. I will now hurry back

589
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,256
to discuss how to solve the problem of "New Youth."

590
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,816
Zhongfu, my thinking is this.

591
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,856
Peking University must exist. "New Youth" must keep running.

592
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,216
I will definitely find a way to satisfy both requirements.

593
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,440
Alright. I'm leaving.

594
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,416
Brother Jiemin.

595
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,176
Brother Zhongfu.

596
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,960
Let's just call today my first of three humble visits to plead my case.

597
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,160
Ok. I will get going.

598
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,736
Brother Mengzou,

599
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,296
I beg of you to handle the matter of signing the contracts.

600
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,456
I have nothing to say to those business men.

601
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,080
I would only get in the way.

602
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,536
What? What do you mean?

603
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,616
You're not going?

604
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,416
Zhongfu, everyone is coming to see you.

605
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,856
Signing the contract is such an important thing.

606
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,960
If you don't show up, how will I explain it to them?

607
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,376
Just say I have an important meeting.

608
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,576
And it's the truth.

609
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,760
I need to go to Taoran Pavilion to see Quan Xuantong.

610
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,616
You're a really strange person.

611
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,136
It's snowing so hard.

612
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,176
And it's so cold.

613
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,336
What are you doing meeting someone at Taoran Pavilion?

614
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,016
To sample the northwesterly wind?

615
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,536
You don't understand.

616
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,536
Heavy snow is romantic.

617
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,176
This is the difference between a reader of books and a seller of books.

618
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,440
To make joy amidst misery is the essence of a scholar.

619
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,920
Not many people these days can keep in tune with such highbrow sentiments.

620
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,776
I surmise

621
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,936
Master Qian will not be singing the same tune.

622
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,296
And I surmise

623
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,720
at this very moment Qian Xuantong is already on his way there.

624
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,816
Zhongfu. Zhongfu.

625
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,816
Don't, Zhongfu.

626
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,920
No, if you leave, what do I do?

627
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,656
Brother Zhongfu!

628
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,576
Deqian, is that you?

629
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,056
I've been looking forward to meeting you. Your reputation preceeds you.

630
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,240
Today, I finally see your face in person.

631
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,616
Myriad entities have different forms, but they are the same in essence.

632
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,936
Though in the corners of the world, we have never met,

633
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,456
we have long since been alike in spirit.

634
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,336
This is true.

635
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,903
{\an8}[Qian Xuantong, styled Deqian: Peking University professor]

636
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:32,857
I am a faithful reader of "New Youth"

637
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,576
and a die-hard supporter of you, Chen Duxiu.

638
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,576
Deqian, you are too modest.

639
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,376
How is it?

640
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,856
To meet at Taoran pavilion in the snow today.

641
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,056
You don't find it odd?

642
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,336
To see Taoran in the snow?

643
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,456
'Elegant' is the only word for it.

644
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,416
How can it be odd?

645
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,560
You don't find it cold?

646
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,936
To meet brother Zhongfu is to be bathed in spring wind.

647
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,536
Any chill is entirely absent.

648
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,216
We are indeed fellow travellers.

649
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,656
We have another fellow traveller.

650
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,616
Let me introduce you.

651
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,136
This is Liu Bannong.

652
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,176
Literary translator.

653
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,456
and famed writer of the "Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies" school of fiction.

654
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,656
Bannong,

655
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,056
I've read many of your translations of European fiction.

656
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,816
It has benefited me a great deal.

657
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,176
Compared to you, sir,

658
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,520
I am but a handful of soil next to Mount Tai.

659
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,576
Why are the people in Beijing

660
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,040
all so modest?

661
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,496
Brother Zhongfu, let's talk in the pavilion.

662
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,256
Certainly.

663
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,416
Speaking of Taoran Pavilion,

664
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,496
among the most famous of its associations

665
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,136
is the composition by Jiang Zao, "Taoran Pavilion."

666
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,736
Reportedly, he often invited

667
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,576
scholars and literati, colleagues and close friends

668
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,040
to come here to feast and compose poetry.

669
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,976
Sure enough, it's a peaceful world in the world of mortals.

670
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,296
It's a pity, wine is left out today!

671
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,176
Brother Zhongfu has come, how can there be no wine?

672
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,200
Someone come! Bring wine!

673
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,960
Come, come.

674
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,456
This wine is Shaoxing yellow wine.

675
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,616
That's right. My hometown's Shaoxing yellow wine.

676
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,776
After it's heated up, use a quilt to wrap it.

677
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,920
It's sent over by a rickshaw.

678
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,456
Deqian, Bannong, you guys really used your heart.

679
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,976
I'm moved, I'm moved.

680
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,056
I'm waiting for my yellow daisies at home to ripen.

681
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,016
We'll get drunk together and have a good time.

682
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,416
Good! Today there's you, there's snow,

683
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,976
there's Shaoxing yellow wine, there's a qin, there's poetry, there's red plums.

684
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,096
Having intimate friends in high mountains and rivers. It is indeed elegant.

685
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,216
Come.

686
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,120
Let us first toast a cup.

687
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,496
How is it?

688
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,840
Warm!

689
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,200
Come.

690
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,176
Banong, weren't you at Shanghai?

691
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,616
How come you also came to Beijing?

692
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,520
Is it to keep up with the latest fashion?

693
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,456
Peking University is making reforms.

694
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,240
I was thinking of coming over to apply for a teaching job.

695
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,136
Is this Beijing so attractive

696
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,536
to cultural people?

697
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,056
It's strange to say that

698
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,056
at present, these scholars,

699
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,256
once arrived, won't leave.

700
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,176
They rush in like ducks,

701
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,376
no matter how poorly they live here.

702
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,336
Why is that?

703
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,576
High culture, low culture.

704
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,680
Dragons and fishes jumbled together, all embracing each other.

705
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,440
The opportunities and risks coexist.

706
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,440
Come.

707
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,880
Brother Zhongfu.

708
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,936
This "New Youth"

709
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,656
is like the fire of today's winter day.

710
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,056
It ignited the light of hope of revitalizing China.

711
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,960
We are all followers of this torch.

712
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,136
This time Duxiu comes to Beijing

713
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,376
to pay his respects to all of you,

714
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,896
to help "New Youth"

715
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,216
to make its fire burn brighter.

716
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,736
An unshirkable responsibility.

717
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,200
Come.

718
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,696
Only, Brother Zhongfu, have you thought about

719
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,788
having "New Youth" move to Beijing.

720
00:34:48,071 --> 00:34:49,733
Beijing.

721
00:34:49,757 --> 00:34:52,136
Can "New Youth" gain a footing in Beijing?

722
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,016
Of course.

723
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,536
More than gain a footing,

724
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,880
to be based in Beijing, we can look at the whole country and develop it.

725
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,976
Come, today we are not going home until we're drunk!

726
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,720
Okay! Cheers. Come.

727
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,576
Excuse me, may I ask

728
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,336
Is the guest home?

729
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,696
Yes. However, he came home pretty late last night.

730
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,136
It seems like he drank a little too much.

731
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,736
I reckon he's still not up at this time.

732
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,480
Let me call for you

733
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,616
Don't wake him up too loudly.

734
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,296
Let him sleep a while more.

735
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,176
Continue.

736
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,840
Alright.

737
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,480
Cabinet minister Cai.

738
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,136
I am Cai Yuanpei.

739
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,496
It's really you!

740
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,896
Y-you, what is this you are doing?

741
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,416
Zhongfu is resting.

742
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,480
I am waiting for him here.

743
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,336
How can this be allowed?

744
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,736
How can we allow you to be so condescending to simple men like this?

745
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,560
I'll call him, I'll call him.

746
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,536
Zhongfu!

747
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,176
Don't, don't, don't.

748
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,656
Zhongfu!

749
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,416
Don't, don't wake him up.

750
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,776
Let him sleep a while more.

751
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,736
I can't, I can't.

752
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,800
I see that you look very familiar.

753
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,336
Cabinet minister Cai, your humble servant Wang Mengzou.

754
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,176
Wang Mengzou... I know.

755
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,776
Scholar of Anhui province's Jixi county.

756
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,536
Director of Yadong county's library.

757
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,216
That library of yours is taken care of really well.

758
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,656
You overpraise.

759
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,376
Zhongfu.

760
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,120
Brother Jiemin.

761
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,560
Zhongfu, Zhongfu, the floor below has people.

762
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,296
I apologize, Brother Jiemin.

763
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,576
I drank too much yesterday.

764
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,216
Quick, enter the room.

765
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:28,936
Come, come, come.

766
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,456
Enter quickly, don't catch a cold.

767
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,256
Forgive me, forgive me.

768
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:31,576
Don't catch a cold.

769
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,096
Forgive me, sir.

770
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,656
Please sit, sir.

771
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,376
You sit, you sit.

772
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,416
I'll offer tea to you.

773
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,920
You take a seat first.

774
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,800
You guys chat first, I'm going to handle some matters.

775
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,840
Cabinet minister Cai, it was nice to meet you, nice to meet you.

776
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,176
Sir, drink tea.

777
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,480
No need, I'm eating peanuts.

778
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,376
Boldly paid a visit, disturbed your rest.

779
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,976
Where?

780
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,976
I just wanted to tell you

781
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,376
Me and Cabinet Minister of Education Fan Yuanlian,

782
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,136
as well as colleagues of Peking University,

783
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,056
after the negotiations feel

784
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,656
you are able to have "New Youth"

785
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,640
brought to Peking University to manage.

786
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,096
At the same time,

787
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,576
"New Youth" can also

788
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,056
implement a lecture on editing for colleagues at Peking University.

789
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,496
If this happens then,

790
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,056
"New Youth" can have Peking University

791
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,456
treated as something to give publicity to Mr. Science and Mr. Democracy,

792
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,696
an exceptionally good platform.

793
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,320
With this, we will promote and spread the New Culture Movement.

794
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,960
I still need to tell you,

795
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,456
the head of humanities course's monthly income is three hundred silver dollars.

796
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,456
Your whole family can go up north,

797
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,760
settle down in Beijing.

798
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,080
Make up your mind. Come to Peking University.

799
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,520
I sincerely need your help.

800
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,296
Honorable Cai, inviting me so kindly like this,

801
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,176
Duxiu is endlessly grateful.

802
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,776
Speaking truthfully, these two days have been a rush of excitement.

803
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,760
Cannot sleep soundly at night.

804
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,616
After drinking some wine yesterday night,

805
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,856
only then have I felt I had a good sleep.

806
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,216
It's just that, the matter of "New Youth" entering Beijing,

807
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,976
its implications are profound.

808
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,896
It involves all aspects,

809
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,920
so I don't dare agree rashly.

810
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,776
How about,

811
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,656
I recommend you someone to be the dean of liberal arts.

812
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,880
For sure, more outstanding than me.

813
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,936
But this dean of liberal arts,

814
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,000
how can it be possible for another person to take it?

815
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,600
Only you can do it.

816
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,696
Zhongfu, Zhongfu.

817
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,440
Please enter.

818
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,176
Zhongfu.

819
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,135
Yihan.

820
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:12,855
Greetings, sir.

821
00:41:12,855 --> 00:41:13,896
Sir.

822
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,816
Bailan, Xingang, you're all here.

823
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,000
Come. Quickly, Come meet Mr. Cai Jiemin.

824
00:41:19,157 --> 00:41:20,565
{\an8}[Gao Yihan, editor of "The Tiger Daily"]

825
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,440
Honorable Cai, it's an honor to meet you at last.

826
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,920
Greetings, Mr. Jiemin.

827
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,560
Greetings everybody.

828
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,976
What brings you here?

829
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,936
Brother Zhongfu.

830
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,256
You are able to arrive in Beijing, it's really too good.

831
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,856
Hearing you already arrived in Beijing,

832
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,576
Mr. Zhang Shizhao specially sent me a telegram.

833
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,736
Let me be sure to invite you

834
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,256
to our "The Tiger Daily" editing department,

835
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,296
to take a look,

836
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,496
and give guidance.

837
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,416
If he doesn't invite me, I would go by myself.

838
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,416
"Jiayin" is my old magazine.

839
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,016
How come Shouchang didn't come?

840
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,336
Shouchang isn't here because he's visiting his family.

841
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,296
In a moment, he will

842
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,256
directly hurry to the editing department.

843
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,960
Alright, then why don't go over right now.

844
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,936
Brother Jiemin

845
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,776
Then... You are--

846
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,800
How about you-- Go over together with us.

847
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,216
It's alright, I'm busy.

848
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,456
I'll come over again next time.

849
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:17,976
Okay, okay, okay.

850
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,816
Mr. Cai, it's really nice to meet you.

851
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,480
You--

852
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,696
Brother Zhongfu.

853
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,056
About the matter of coming to Peking University,

854
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:34,200
I am still asking you to carefully think it over again.

855
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,440
I have been sincere.

856
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,776
These peanuts are really delicious.

857
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,080
Take care.

858
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,696
Sir. I'll send you.

859
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,576
Take care, sir.

860
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,096
No need to send me out. I can do it.

861
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,920
Mr. Cai, walk well.

862
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,520
Come. Please enter, please enter.

863
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,800
Brother Zhongfu, you're welcome to look around.

864
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,336
"The Tiger Daily" editing department.

865
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,720
This is Mr. Xingyan's great work.
