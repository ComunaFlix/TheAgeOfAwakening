4
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,416
World War I

5
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,600
entered its second year of unprecedented tragedy.

6
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,216
While Germany was distracted in the European theatre,

7
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,960
Japan stepped up its expansion in China.

8
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,816
During the period

9
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,576
of the Second Revolution's failure,

10
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,240
Sun Yat-sen and others were forced into exile overseas.

11
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,336
Bourgeois revolutionaries

12
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,816
were unable to carry out the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle to the end.

13
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,416
Domestic political chaos,

14
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,216
the suffering of the people,

15
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,976
internal trouble and foreign aggression.

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,640
China was once again thrown into a tumultuous situation.

17
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,280
Mr. President,

18
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,416
Japanese diplomat Hioki Eki has sent an ultimatum

19
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,496
to be answered within forty-eight hours.

20
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,920
What does the ultimatum say?

00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,560
then Japan will take necessary measures.

{\an8}[Cao Rulin, styled Runtian, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China]

What does he want?

28
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,976
Hioki Eki said

29
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,480
Japan is to take over Shandong in the northeast.

30
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:04,096
Japanese... They still want us dead.

31
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,336
This afternoon, the Ministry of War reported

32
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,096
that Japanese naval formations

33
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,976
are heading for our southeast coast.

34
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,640
What?

35
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,696
Does he still want a Jiawu War (=First Sino-Japanese War)?

36
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,296
Make no mistake.

37
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,536
I am Yuan Shikai,

38
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,536
not Li Hongzhang.

39
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,376
For a long time, there have been discussions in Japan

40
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,576
advocating for Japanese intervention

41
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,080
in our country's Yangtze River basin as soon as possible.

42
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,896
Stupid... Stupid...

43
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,256
You didn't tell Hioki Eki that

44
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,616
it's not that I, Yuan Shikai, who disagreed with the Twenty-One Demands.

45
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,856
It's the people who are rebelling so much.

46
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,056
It was them who hid Sun Yat-sen and Huang Xing in Japan.

47
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,936
Didn't I say we should respect public opinion?

48
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,856
Mr. President, our appeal has worked.

49
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,776
The Japanese agree that the articles in Section 5

50
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,376
can be discussed later.

51
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,360
But... the treaty must be signed immediately.

52
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,576
How does your Ministry of Foreign Affairs respond?

53
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,176
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs obeys the orders of the President.

54
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,016
How cunning.

55
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,640
Then accept the Japanese terms.

56
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,096
Now Sun Yat-sen, Huang Xing and the others will make trouble again.

57
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,936
All these people have gone overseas.

58
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,000
It won't be a big deal.

59
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:29,536
Right.

60
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,216
Runtian, tell the Japanese

61
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,280
the treaty will be signed,

62
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,416
but Section 5 of the Demands will not be accepted.

63
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,576
This is the bottom line.

64
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,096
I gave him face,

65
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,256
he should also give me some.

66
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,176
Understood, Mr. President.

67
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,976
What is the deadline for the Japanese?

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,016
Nine days.

69
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,096
Then wait until the night of the ninth day

70
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,240
to inform the Japanese.

71
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,336
Extra! Extra!

72
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,416
Today's extra is very strange!

73
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,496
President Yuan Shikai

74
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,896
is selling out the country!

75
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,216
The wastrel, sells, sells, sells!

76
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,616
His support is not afraid to rise up,

77
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,696
but the common masses do not agree

78
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,696
to be angry and not fight!

79
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,056
Look at this woman! So angry, she steps on the extra!

80
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,200
Look at this man! So angry, he breaks his crutch!

By order of Yuan Shikai,

83
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,976
an agreement is signed with Japan,

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,696
the national humiliation of the Twenty-One Demands.

85
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,896
According to this treaty,

86
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,896
China recognizes Japan's inheritence of

87
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,456
all German rights and interests in Shandong.

88
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,176
Japan in southern Manchuria and eastern Mongolia in China

89
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,256
will enjoy special rights.

90
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,456
Japan will get in China

91
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,576
various railway construction rights, and so on.

92
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,496
The Beiyang government's treasonous acts

93
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,296
were strongly opposed by the nation.

94
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,416
All major cities in China,

95
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,896
like Beijing, Guangzhou, Wuhan,

96
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,016
Qingdao, and other places

97
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,976
all held huge demonstrations.

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,216
Shanghai dockers went on strike

99
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,816
announcing a boycott of Japanese goods.

100

Fuzhou and other places

held various protests one after another.

103

Refusing to recognise the Twenty-One Demands

104
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,856
and vowing to avenge national humiliation

105
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,336
demonstrate a strong anti-imperialist stance

106
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,736
and a strong patriotic passion.

107

is not something you and I can control.

now that the country is in trouble and the Republic is dying,

you're all being a bit eccentric here.

Are you still Chinese?

Do you have any patriotism left in you?

00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,856
That's right! Are you Chinese?!

156
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,896
China has been in this state

157

for much more than a day or two.

158
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,856
Can you save the country like this?

159
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,656
It's all because of you apathetic people!

160
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,136
China is falling into a ditch that way!

161
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,240
Yeah! It is because of you!

Because of us?

163
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,120
We won't go along with this accusation.

00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,816
the grotesque situation we find ourselves in today.

169
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,056
Yuan Shikai's attempt to introduce a constitutional monarchy

170
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,536
was a real return to the correct path.

171
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,616
This is the way to save China.

172
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,976
The foundation of prosperity.

173
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,016
Nonsense!

174
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,016
Ridiculous! Ridiculous!

175
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,536
The idea of a democratic republic

176
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,056
is already well established.

177
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,656
Aren't you driving backwards in history?

178
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,096
Yeah! That's right! Driving backwards!

179
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,976
We are the ones driving backwards in history?

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,736
Or is it you revolutionaries?

181
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,296
Ignoring China's national conditions!

182
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,616
Students! Countrymen!

183
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,696
Kang Youwei has long said

184
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,576
a revolution is not a good thing for a country.

185
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,776
The French Revolution,

186
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,416
eighty years of turmoil and bloodshed of millions.

187
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,936
Furthermore, the Chinese people are not yet open-minded.

188
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,056
In this case,

189
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,736
the forced imposition of a republican system

190
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,696
will be like duckweed floating on water, with no roots!

191
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,525
Zhang Fengzai, what you just said

192
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:48,976
is absolutely absurd!

193
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,416
Kang Youwei's words

194
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,216
have been refuted by many revolutionary martyrs.

195
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,816
The revolution will certainly shed blood.

196
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,656
But I would like to ask you,

197
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,336
will the constitutional monarchy, also not shed blood?

198
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:00,896
Right!

199
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,679
{\an8}[Zhang Shizhao, styled Xingyan, famous social activist forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]

200
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,896
Yeah! That's right!

201
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,696
Britain, Austria, Germany, Italy.

202
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,296
Which country has not experienced

203
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,976
many changes

204
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,416
and made great sacrifices

205
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,856
before it has achieved real social progress?

206
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,536
Another thing I want to ask you is,

207
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,536
what did you just say?

208
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,216
Our country's people are not yet open-minded?

209
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,696
That's demonstrably false!

210
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,456
Since the Xinhai Revolution,

211
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,136
the entire population's thinking

212
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,496
has already undergone earth-shaking changes.

213
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,296
Judging from the unanimous rejection of Yuan at home and abroad,

214
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,136
this is hard evidence.

215
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,696
The more the nation is in peril,

216
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,176
the more it should call people's consciousness

217
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,256
and invigorate the national spirit.

218
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,736
And if the idea of republicanism

219
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,776
is to be instilled in the people,

220
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,976
it is necessary to overthrow the feudal ideology.

221
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,256
Zhang Fengzai, those who go against the tide of history

222
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,976
will be drowned by the torrent of the times.

223
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,656
For the love of country,

224
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,856
we must save our country. Overthrow Yuan.

225
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,416
For our Chinese nation,

226
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,696
we must save our country. Overthrow Yuan!

227
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:13,880
Save the country! Overthrow Yuan!

228
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,748
Well said!

229
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:16,720
Well said!

230
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,000
Mr. Xingyan. Mr. Xingyan.

231
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,936
Hello students.

232
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,376
Shouchang's words

233
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,416
were well-reasoned, authentic,

234
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,296
passionate, engaging.

235
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,656
Excellent.

236
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,376
Zhongfu, what do you think?

237
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,920
Zhongfu? Chen Duxiu?

238
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,456
It's Chen Duxiu!

239
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,384
Chen Duxiu!

240
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:40,736
Is it Chen Duxiu?

241
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,176
Why does he look like that?

242
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:49,009
{\an8}[Chen Duxiu, styled Zhongfu, famous revolutionary forced into exile in Japan for his participation in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]

243
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,296
Could it be Chen Duxiu?

244
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,120
It can't be.

245
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,536
As you said,

246
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,376
he is a very knowledgeable young man.

247
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,960
Chen Duxiu.

248
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,816
Why are you eating here?

249
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,336
I was just passing by

250
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,616
seeing them bickering.

251
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,216
No one was eating.

252
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,216
Food should not be wasted at any time.

253
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,520
It's shameful to waste food

254
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,880
What time is it? You're still eating here?

255
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,840
Are you Chen Duxiu?

256
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,696
I am, yes.

257
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,256
He really is!

258
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,160
I am Chen Duxiu.

259
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,336
He is! He's Chen Duxiu!

260
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,320
Quiet, everyone!

261
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,080
Quiet!

262
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,416
Since Mr. Zhongfu is here,

263
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,776
we would like to ask you,

264
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,976
what do you think should be done to save China?

265
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,496
I think that

266
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,936
such a country is hopeless.

267
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,376
What did you say?

268
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,240
Are you Chinese? How can you say that?

269
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,176
Chen Duxiu. Are you talking about people?

270
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,400
Simply shameless!

271
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,176
Shameless!

272
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,816
What are you doing?

273
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,400
You've gone too far!

274
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,176
Mr. Zhongfu, what you just said,

275
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,176
do you really believe that?

276
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,616
Yes, of course.

277
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,976
But yeah, I meant to say...

278
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,814
You see?!

279
00:13:56,838 --> 00:13:59,136
Students! You have seen it!

280
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,616
This is what you call a revolutionary!

281
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,216
A great revolutionary!

282
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,056
Do you know what he said?

283
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,216
He said he didn't care for his country's subjugation!

284
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,416
What else?

285
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,776
What's terrible of being a slave to a subjugated country?

286
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,840
Where is the love for a country of a brutalized people?

287
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,776
This is the real traitor! A hanjian!

288
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,096
Traitor! Hanjian!

289
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,136
Hanjian!

290
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,736
Get out of the way!

291
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,040
Don't do it!

292
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,656
Let's just talk!

293
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,936
Don't do it!

294
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,056
Stop!

295
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,159
Don't do it!

296
00:14:33,183 --> 00:14:33,720
Don't do it!

297
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,136
Mr. Zhongfu, go!

298
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,136
Don't do it!

299
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,856
Let's just talk! Don't do it!

300
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,456
Come on, this way!

301
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,296
Don't do it, people, don't do it!

302
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,176
Listen to me for a moment!

303
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,410
Mr. Xingyan has a message for everyone!

304
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:46,976
Mr. Xingyan has a message for everyone!

305
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,176
Come on, everyone, let me tell you something!

306
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,080
Come on, come on!

307
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,216
Alright.

308
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,776
Alright, alright, no one is following.

309
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,520
Take a break, take a break.

310
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,000
Not like Chen Duxiu, right?

311
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,376
I just imagined

312
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,376
something a little different.

313
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,000
So what do you imagine it should be like?

314
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,680
Are you okay?

315
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,976
I apologise for the situation.

316
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,880
It's okay, I've seen a lot of these.

317
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,616
Your article

318
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,056
"Self Consciousness on Patriotism", I've read it.

319
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,296
But there are many doubts and unanswered questions.

320
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,216
I would like to ask you some, is that okay?

321
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,336
I know that you, Li Dazhao, are from Hebei.

322
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,776
Yanzhao is full of generous and sorrowful people, they insist endlessly.

323
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,736
But now in China

324
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,136
there is a shortage of real men who insist endlessly.

325
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,176
Ask.

326
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,896
You said that patriotism should have a position,

327
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,496
and not, under the banner of patriotism,

328
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,976
be one of Yuan Shikai's obedient subjects.

329
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,296
Then according to you,

330
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,656
as long as Yuan Shikai is in power,

331
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,880
people should not be patriotic.

332
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,416
You stubborn man, you misunderstood.

333
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,256
I meant to say,

334
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,656
patriotism should have a position,

335
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,296
and patriotism should not be confused

336
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,416
with loyalty to Yuan Shikai,

337
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,696
under the banner of patriotism,

338
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,976
covering up Yuan Shikai's usurp of state power.

339
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,416
This is similar to what you just said,

340
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,856
is it not?

341
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,976
Then Yuan Shikai

342
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,096
keeps saying that he represents the country,

343
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,176
he is confusing different concepts.

344
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,616
If patriotism has no position,

345
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,296
then we simply have no reason

346
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,056
to defeat Yuan Shikai.

347
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,816
I completely agree.

348
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,576
I think the first priority today is

349
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,856
to inspire the people to be truly patriotic.

350
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,416
Right now, China is being divided up by the Western powers.

351
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,776
If everyone is not patriotic,

352
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,856
then the country will die.

353
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,256
Shouchang, I ask you,

354
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,456
What did the Western powers rely on to carve up China?

355
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,336
Gunboats.

356
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,296
No.

357
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,776
You are talking about the Opium War and naval failure of the Jiawu War.

358
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,160
Now the powers are dividing China by borrowing money.

359
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,296
The Chinese government

360
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,976
borrows foreign debt from Western countries every year,

361
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,376
accounting for more than half of the treasury's revenue

362
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,000
in a country without productivity.

363
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,536
Only by relying on the national tax railway as collateral

364
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,776
can we borrow money to maintain political power.

365
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,016
What do you expect from a country like this?

366
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,416
That's why we're going to overthrow Yuan,

367
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,256
overthrow this corrupt government,

368
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,536
and build a new nation.

369
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,040
No!

370
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,256
Can China be saved by political revolution?

371
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,176
China's problems are accumulating.

372
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,440
Can we solve the problems by changing people or governments?

373
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,456
So according to you,

374
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,376
our China has no way out?

375
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,040
There is a way, but the way out is not the old way.

376
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,776
The way out is a new way.

377
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,296
China will not die.

378
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,416
What is the old way?

379
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,776
The dynastic cycle.

380
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,656
The overthrow of an old dynasty,

381
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,776
the establishment of a new dynasty.

382
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,376
The cycle repeats itself. It's the old way.

383
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,496
And what is the new way?

384
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,080
Don't know.

385
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,280
That's what I'm looking for.

386
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,816
Shouchang, I appreciate your knowledge and talent.

387
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,216
Will you look for this new path with me?

388
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,856
To find a way to save China

389
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,736
is my life's work.

390
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,560
I will.

391
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,640
Good.

392
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,320
Zhongfu!

393
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,936
You've both come here

394
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,856
and made us look for you!

395
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,416
Tickets... we have the tickets.

396
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,800
Tomorrow we can go back home.

397
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,856
Excellent. Finally we can go back.

398
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,656
Zhongfu, before I go back,

399
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,056
I finally got to see Shouchang.

400
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,976
It's not in vain that you took

401
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,758
the crime of being a traitor.

402
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:11,108
Not in vain... not in vain...

403
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,040
See me?

404
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,416
Yeah.

405
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,056
He's here to see you today.

406
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,496
Ever since he was on the "The Tiger",

407
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,496
and read your article,

408
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,416
he's been wanting to see you.

409
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,616
It was worth the trip.

410
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,280
The harvest is very rich, such as the treasure.

411
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,656
You... you always stay indoors and write articles

412
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,456
not letting us care for you,

413
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,416
nor letting us ask questions,

414
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,336
making yourself like a beggar.

415
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,960
Unkept hair, dirty face, and body covered in lice.

416
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:40,440
{\an8}[Yi Baisha, styled Yuecun, famous thinker forced into exile in Japan for participating in the "Second Revolution" against Yuan Shikai]

417
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,856
You'll scare Junman back home!

418
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,816
Hurry back!

419
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,816
Cut your hair, take a bath, and change your clothes.

420
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,016
There's a bath

421
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,176
and there is only one change of clothes.

422
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,816
Alright.

423
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,440
Brother Zhongfu. Wait.

424
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,000
It's windy at sea. Take care of yourself.

425
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,320
Okay, then I'll be glad to do so.

426
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,016
Shouchang, I owe you three favours today.

427
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,496
In the future, you must remember to ask for them.

428
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,376
What are they?

429
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,216
One is to help me get out of trouble.

430
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,976
Second is to lend me clothes.

431
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,256
And the third?

432
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,320
I ate your food.

433
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,016
But before I had enough to eat,

434
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,456
I was beaten away.

435
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,056
Then keep rubbing it in!

436
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,416
Can I buy you all dinner?

437
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,936
We haven't even eaten yet.

438
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,976
Then we'll rub along.

439
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,200
Good, Brother Zhongfu, this way.

440
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,440
Zhongfu, what time is it already, you're still not going to sleep?

441
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,176
What is there worth seeing outside?

442
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,280
The boat passed Shandong.

443
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,400
I feel apprehensive as I near home.

444
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,816
The boat passed Shandong.

445
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,040
There's anger in my heart. I want to scold someone.

446
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,840
I want to scold Yuan Shikai.

447
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,280
I also want to scold this Yuan Datou (=Silver coin engraved with Yuan's large head).

448
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,936
I don't know what he's thinking,

449
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,496
he dared to give Qingdao to Japan.

450
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,520
You say, did this guy take the wrong medicine?

451
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,096
Yuan Shikai did not take the wrong medicine.

452
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,336
It's our country

453
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,480
that is already incurable.

454
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,416
Why do you say that?

455
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,696
Think about it.

456
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,496
Since Lin Zexu banned opium in the Daoguang era,

457
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,280
it's been seventy-five years.

458
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,656
In the middle of this, how many people

459
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,936
thought of different ways

460
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,416
but still couldn't save the Great Qing dynasty.

461
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,856
Sun Yat-sen introduced the Republic from the West,

462
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,616
people of the country all thought that this

463
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,616
was a remedy to save the country and enrich the people.

464
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,896
Who would have thought, the republic works in other countries

465
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,296
but inside of China it does not work anymore.

466
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,760
After three or four years of the Republic,

467
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,400
the country is not as good as it used to be.

468
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,016
Since there is no cure,

469
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,856
then isn't taking the old way better.

470
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,736
These aren't the thoughts of just one or two people.

471
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,776
Baisha.

472
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,976
Isn't it?

473
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,296
You said that Liang Shiyi's gang is now

474
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,880
jumping up and down in tandem everywhere,

475
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,776
joining Master Yang Hu (=ROC Lieutenant General), Yan Jidao (=Yan Fu's alias)

476
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,800
also serving their tiger master to make a scene.

477
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,600
Unreasonable.

478
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,536
Yang Du, Yan Fu.

479
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,896
They are the wisest who can have a momentary lapse in judgement,

480
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,056
whereas that Liang Shiyi group

481
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,496
are political hooligans with no moral bottom line.

482
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,936
I made up a name for them

483
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,160
called Li Yilian.
(lit. propriety, righteousness, honesty)

484
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,160
Li Yilian, what does this mean?

485
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,480
Li Yilian, is shameless!
(lit. propriety, righteousness, honesty, and a sense of shame; famous Chinese idiom)

486
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,576
Extremely shameless! Most shameless of all!

487
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,840
Good! What a good Li Yilian!

488
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,600
Zhongfu, your thinking is clearly unusual!

489
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,760
Baisha, I'm ashamed.

490
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,456
For more than ten years,

491
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,096
I, Chen Duxiu, first learned Kang Liang,

492
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,016
followed by [Sun] Yat-sen,

493
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,616
committed to the political revolution,

494
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,176
running this way and that way escaping death many times.

495
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,176
Going to Japan alone for five times.

496
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,376
As a result,

497
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,536
nothing is still achieved right?

498
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,216
China's affairs,

499
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,056
by relying on political revolution,

500
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,376
doesn't solve the fundamental problem.

501
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,440
To get to the bottom of this, we must change our way of thinking.

502
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,296
Do you have any new ideas?

503
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,816
I don't dare to say my new ideas.

504
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,880
On my return this time,

505
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,880
I've made up my mind.

506
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,016
For twenty years, I'm not going to touch politics.

507
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,176
If you're not going to touch politics, then what do you want to do?

508
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,816
Be reborn. Change one's body, change one's mind.

509
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,720
It's not early anymore.

510
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,120
Hurry up and go to sleep.

511
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,960
Zhongfu, what time is it already?

512
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,256
What are you still sitting there for?

513
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,136
It's so dark out there,

514
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,416
you can't see anything at all.

515
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,040
Sleep. Turn off the lights, okay?

516
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,960
I do see.

517
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,480
We, students,

518
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:32,975
{\an8}[Waseda University dormitory]

519
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,856
especially among the people, should bear great responsibilities.

520
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,416
Those who study spiritual academics

521
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,456
should produce beautiful literature

522
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,776
and noble thinking

523
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,360
to contribute to the spiritual development of our nation.

524
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,416
Those who study material academics

525
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,776
should pay close attention to their profound thinking

526
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,016
and apply them exquisitely

527
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:56,080
to seek the development of our country's military technology and instruments.

528
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,776
The spirit of sincerity is omnipotent,

529
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,136
and if held with sincerity and perseverance.

530
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,480
one will have a great functional career.

531
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,856
Based on the ignorance of conscience,

532
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,176
Cao Mo will avenge shame
(cf. legend of General Cao Mo robbing Duke Huan of Qi)

533
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,176
and Goujian will take revenge,
(cf. King Goujian of Yue's revenge on the state of Wu)

534
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,336
when the time comes.

535
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,216
Brother Fengzai, I say, you are really capable.

536
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,056
Things are prepared so well!

537
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,656
This mahjong game, I really love playing!

538
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,560
I also love playing!

539
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,776
Brother Fengzai, you are truly wise and brilliant.

540
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,136
You unexpectedly got everyone ship tickets for a second class cabin.

541
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,256
At the fourth class cabin, we

542
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,376
were laughing together with the poor.

543
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,696
That was so boring!

544
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,296
Right! So boring!

545
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,216
All of this doesn't mean much.

546
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,656
My second uncle said

547
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,576
Yuan Shikai wants to become an emperor.

548
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,416
He's just the head of palace affairs.

549
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,896
When you return home, help us do more publicity.

550
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,336
In the future, I will surely not treat everyone unfairly.

551
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,336
No problem!

552
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:50,816
Xifeng.

553
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,336
I say, Brother Fengzai.

554
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,936
For the sake of Yuan Shikai,

555
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,176
we don't even want to go study abroad.

556
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,760
You have to tell Second Uncle about it, right?

557
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,936
I say,

558
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,096
do all of you have this doubt?

559
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,840
Of course!

560
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,016
Okay!

561
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,400
Then let me help you all dispel these doubts.

562
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,320
My second uncle says,

563
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,496
as long as work is done,

564
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,816
we can all go to study at Beida (=Peking University).

565
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,376
Are you serious?

566
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,616
Then we will have boundless prospects.

567
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,376
This is great! Beida!

568
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,240
I was waiting for this sentence from you!

569
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,536
Zhongfu!

570
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,176
Somebody made way for you,

571
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,936
why did you not acknowledge them?

572
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,536
This is unreasonable.

573
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,760
Who is this person?

574
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,216
He is a famous Chinese United League veteran.

575
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,336
General Zou Yongcheng, commander of the Third Army of Hunan-Henan coalition forces.

576
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,856
You need to give him an apology.

577
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,656
I've always been uninterested in bureaucrats.

578
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,640
Look at you!

Greetings General Zou.

582
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,080
Mr. Zhongfu

583
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,656
General Zou isn't an ordinary official.

584
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,896
In the second year or the Republic, Song Jiaoren was killed.

585
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,536
General Zou deeply felt that the Republic would fall apart.

586
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,136
He left a suicide poem,

587
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,536
jumped into the Huangpu River in anger and attempted suicide.

588
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,456
"After more than ten years of revolution,

589
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,136
Hu Lu (=Xiongnu, a.k.a ruling Manchus of Qing) was expelled from their ancestral whip.

590
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,056
Only to find that the ape (=Yuan) somersaulted out,

591
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,976
the Republic became a dream and I returned to Heaven."

592
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,576
How noble and majestic!

593
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,440
Not really, my humble self is a simple man.

594

Jumping into Huangpu River to commit suicide.

595
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,440
Just an attempt?

596
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,736
Indeed, it was an attempt.

597
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,120
Luckily rescued by fishermen.

598
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,056
If so,

I actually think you are a fool.

600

How can a revolutionary kill himself so easily?

601

I, Chen Duxiu, in this life,

602
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,320
would never do anything stupid to kill myself for the revolution.

Zhongfu!

604
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,376
General Zou, I apologize.

605
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,280
It's alright.

Maybe one day,

611

I will also be like Qu Yuan,

jumping into a river to commit suicide.

613
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,080
At that time, will you also come ridicule me?

614
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,560
Sorry, Baisha.

615
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,840
I'm not in a good mood, I forgot my manners.

and recently ran to Shanghai.

622

Pity her, she is both an aunt and a stepmother,

00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,000
I really don't know

626
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,736
how they survive.

627
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,696
You... This way of managing the family is questionable

628
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,736
I heard you insist on not giving

living expenses to the two brothers Yannian and Qiaonian.

Why can't they take this kind of suffering?

00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,056
Get out of here for me!

667
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,016
His leg already had an injury

668
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,056
What's wrong if the things fell on the ground?

669
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,256
Isn't it fine if it's picked up

670
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,776
What the fuck does his injury have to do with me!

671
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,216
You have to take responsibility for delaying business!

672
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,056
But you still can't beat someone up!

673
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,136
I just did. So what?

674
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,280
Believe it or not I'll beat both of you together

675
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,376
What are you doing?

676
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,816
What are you doing?

677
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,776
Don't hit!

678
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,576
You can't fight!

679
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,462
Want to rebel, is that right?

680
00:31:15,486 --> 00:31:17,229
Want to rebel, is that right!

681
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,376
You are quite a righteous brat, huh?

682
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,696
Fine, today I'll let you handle this first issue.

683
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,216
Old Jia's life, you take care of.

684
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,336
All of you can't get involved.

685
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,696
Whoever comes out will do it themselves.

686
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,896
Come!

687
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,696
I'll do it.

688
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,256
Me too.

689
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,176
Count me in!

690
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,176
Since you two volunteered, you two do it.

691
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,216
Come!

692
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,960
No more nonsense!

693
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,880
Come!

694
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,456
Who's next? Break it up!

695
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,896
What are you still looking at? Scatter!

696
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,536
Turn over these two.

697
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,416
It's nothing, all of you go back to work!

698
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,680
Grab here.

699
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,320
Okay.

700
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,019
Here!

701
00:31:54,043 --> 00:31:55,583
Lift

702
00:31:57,614 --> 00:31:59,257
Lift

703
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,856
All right all right. Go do your job.

704
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,976
What are you being distracted for!

705
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,256
Pick up those beans cleanly for me.

706
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,256
If you miss even one grain, I'll kill you.

707
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,136
Quickly!

708
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,560
Hurry up!

709
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,496
Older brother.

710
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,376
I can't hold on anymore.

711
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,736
Hurry and put it down! Don't injure your waist.

712
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,520
That's not it, my waistband broke.

713
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,656
Well then...

714
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,400
Put your legs together!

715
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,320
Don't move, alright.

716
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,720
What are you messing around for? Quickly!

717
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,120
Take your legs out.

718
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,160
Put on your shoes.

719
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,560
You don't even want your shoes on now, huh?

720
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,896
Let go! Let go!

721
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,936
Let go of me.

722
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,319
What's going on?

723
00:32:59,343 --> 00:33:00,256
What's going on?

724
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:00,976
Let go of me!

725
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,936
You guys can't be like this!

726
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,856
Stop right now! What do you guys want to do!

727
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,376
Let go. Let go of me!

728
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,256
Get your hands off of me!

729
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,056
What are you guys doing!

730
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,696
You can't be like this!

731
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,200
Let go of me!

732
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,056
What are you doing

733
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,856
Let go of me!

734
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,056
They're hurting someone!

735
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,120
That's a girl!

736
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,880
What are you doing?

737
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,960
Let go! Let go!

738
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,696
Hands off! Take your hands off right now!

739
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,376
What the heck is going on down there?

740
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,816
Throw them overboard at portside!

741
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,480
Let me go!

742
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,136
Out of the way

743
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,720
Stop fighting

744
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,456
Who!

745
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,433
Who did it?

746
00:33:40,457 --> 00:33:42,096
Who did it?

747
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,856
Who threw it?

748
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,456
What are you guys doing?

749
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,616
Do you want to steal money or jump into the sea and run away?

750
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,736
Our boat tickets were stolen!

751
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,736
We just arrived on deck!

752
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,296
Don't hit!

753
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,416
Just forget it!

754
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,136
Let go!

755
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,640
Just forget it!

756
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,865
Stop fighting!

757
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:11,571
Stop fighting!

758
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,056
Good!

759
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,336
Stop the ruckus!

760
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,616
It's forbidden to make a ruckus here.

761
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,056
We are on the ocean.

762
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,656
This boat belongs to Japan.

763
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:34,736
People who don't have a boat ticket must buy one.

764
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,456
So, everyone don't misunderstand

765
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,296
We conducted an investigation in secret

766
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:44,256
and found out that those two originally did not have boat tickets,

767
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,136
therefore

768
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:49,360
these two must buy boat tickets.

769
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,616
Let these two youths off.

770
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,240
The boat tickets, I'll pay for them.

771
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,136
Okay as long as the tickets are purchased, it's fine.

772
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,736
It's not okay! You guys...

773
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,416
You have to apologize to these two Chinese youngsters.

774
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,296
This is our Japanese ocean liner,

775
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,976
we are carrying out official business.

776
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,296
There is no reason to apologize, you guys better not go too far.

777
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,376
Is beating people carrying out official business?

778
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,376
Is humiliating a woman carrying out official business?

779
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,376
Is taking off a girl's clothes carrying out official business?

780
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,416
I'm telling you guys...

781
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,416
you Japanese people are abusing your power,

782
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,016
wantonly insulting us Chinese people.

783
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,696
This is an insult to our China!

784
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,976
This is international waters!

785
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,616
This is

786
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,936
a big matter that is enough to cause an international incident.

787
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,736
Will you stop

788
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,280
messing around before this matter gets out of hand?

789
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,847
Apologize!

790
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:27,456
Apologize!

791
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,936
Apologize! Apologize!

792
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,090
Apologize!

793
00:35:31,114 --> 00:35:32,416
Apologize!

794
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,696
Apologize! Apologize!

795
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,676
Apologize! Apologize! Apologize! Bad guys, apologize!

796
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,136
Apologize! Apologize!

797
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,016
Apologize! Apologize!

798
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,320
Apologize! Apologize!

799
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,256
Okay! I got it!

800
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,600
You two quickly apologize.

801
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,520
Sorry. Sorry.

802
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,800
Hey, let's go!

803
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,690
We won!

804
00:36:00,714 --> 00:36:02,840
We won!

805
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,296
We won!

806
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,616
This is the victory? What was the victory?

807
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,376
The three words "I am sorry", and it's over?

808
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,256
That's right!

809
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,936
Does this count as victory?

810
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,296
Keep fighting!

811
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,056
Come back and keep fighting!

812
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,696
What are you saying!

813
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,896
Are you still human?

814
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,496
Seeing your fellow citizen being bullied...

815
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,376
not coming out to lend a hand...

816
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,656
instead, you are on the side making sarcastic remarks.

817
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,016
Are you still Chinese?

818
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,400
Do still know what shame is?

819
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,336
You know what shame is,

820
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,176
what's the point of showing off here?

821
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,336
If you have the ability fight a battle in Europe,

822
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,096
you would exterminate the Eight-Nation Alliance.

823
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:34,496
That's right!

824
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,456
That's what is called ability.

825
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,256
You!

826
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,376
What do you want to do?

827
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,216
A Chinese people fighting each other

828
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,016
Come

829
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,016
Let foreigners properly see...

830
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,096
how Chinese people bully each other

831
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,840
Come

832
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,016
Do you see it?

833
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,616
Chinese people are bullying each other!

834
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,816
Come  Everyone come see

835
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,800
Stop quarrelling, all of you go back for me

836
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,016
Let's go

837
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,790
All of you go back

838
00:36:54,814 --> 00:36:56,177
All of you go back

839
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,200
Don't be angry, don't lower yourself to their level

840
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,560
Make way

841
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,896
Raise your feet a little

842
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,720
You stepped on my tile

843
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,000
What tile?

844
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,840
Little... Little chick it seems like

845
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,400
This eyesight of yours is not good

846
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,520
It's a cake

847
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,360
Play often?

848
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,480
Why did you throw the tile!

849
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,560
Fellow citizens being insulted

850
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,256
is far less important

851
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,736
than your mahjong game, is it?

852
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,416
What does this hell does have to do with playing Mahjong!

853
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,376
What did you throw my tile for?

854
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,776
How can they be justified in taking tickets?

855
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,936
The reason why the country is not prospering...

856
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,800
is that the people's wisdom is not yet open.

857
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,256
Meaning?!

858
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,936
Playing mahjong...

859
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,776
What does it matter whether the people are open or not?

860
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,816
What did you throw my tiles for?

861
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,256
You guys still want to lose face?

862
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,016
Us Chinese people arguing amongst ourselves here...

863
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,456
We let the foreigners see a joke

864
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,256
Everyone else, go back to your cabin. Right now

865
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,760
Let's go

866
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,656
Mr. Zhongfu, are you alright?

867
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,696
I'm alright

868
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,736
General Yongcheng

869
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,896
My discourteousness from before

870
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,120
I formally apologize to you

871
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,933
You are a fellow

872
00:38:16,957 --> 00:38:18,646
I'm ashamed

873
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,800
Thank you sirs

874
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,656
Sir,

875
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,456
The boat ticket money...

876
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,136
We will for sure return it to you as soon as possible

877
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,416
No need no need

878
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,616
We are all Chinese people

879
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,216
Helping each other is what we should do

880
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,640
Thank you

881
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,696
Mr. Zhongfu.

882
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,256
Your help, despite what happened yesterday,

883
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,456
I wholeheartedly thank you

884
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,760
What about the events of yesterday?

885
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,776
You forgot

886
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,376
At Waseda,

887
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,760
I spit a mouthful on you

888
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,176
How about if I didn't forget

889
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,536
spitting back at you

890
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,976
You spit a mouthful of phlegm on me

891
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,416
it's your bravery

892
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,376
Today's fight...

893
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,736
is our bravery

894
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,416
But it's only by bravery

895
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,336
This fight is going to last until when?

896
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,856
The principles in this, do you understand?

897
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,536
I will wholeheartedly listen to your instructions

898
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,816
Good

899
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,096
Then let's go inside the cabins to chat

900
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,456
General Yongcheng, please

901
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,520
Let's go.   Come.

902
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,240
Qiaonian

903
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,640
Good  Now I won't be afraid of it falling

904
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,840
Here

905
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,320
Brother Yannian, Brother Qiaonian!

906
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,456
What are you doing here?

907
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,336
What good food are you eating?

908
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,160
I also want to eat!

909
00:40:59,055 --> 00:41:01,810
{\an8}[Chen Zimei, daughter of Chen Duxiu]

910
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,296
Aunt!

911
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,568
Yannian, Qiaonian.

912
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:10,416
{\an8}[Gao Junman, wife of Chen Duxiu]

913
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,856
So hard to eat!

914
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,680
What's wrong Zimei?

915
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,816
Don't eat this anymore.

916
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,120
Aunt brought over some buns for you guys.

917
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,736
It just came out of the boiler.

918
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,560
Eat the buns.

919
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,080
Aunt, we won't eat it.

920
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,016
Aunt is not an foreigner.

921
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,160
What is it that you can't eat.

922
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,856
You eat it

923
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,760
Thank you aunt

924
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,960
I brought you guys egg soup

925
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:55,856
Here

926
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,136
Fresh out of the pot

927
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,800
Thank you aunt

928
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,056
Yannian. Come, eat some buns

929
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,776
Aunt, money is used to buy this

930
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,800
When you look at it, it doesn't look good. Once you eat it, it's quite flavorful

931
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,680
Where's Henian

932
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,896
He's not feeling very well

933
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,200
I had a neighbour help look after him

934
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,096
Yannian, Qiaonian

935
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,736
Aunt has come here many times to urge you guys...

936
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,736
You guys are always stubbornly not willing to come home with me

937
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,496
Your father is about to come back

938
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,560
Come home with aunt

939
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,496
We won't go back

940
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,800
We don't have anything to do with this person

941
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,560
But you guys working outside like this...

942
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,176
is truly a lot of hardship

943
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,936
Can't even get hot food to eat

944
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,736
Come home with me

945
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,496
Good or bad, you can eat something hot

946
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,256
Okay?

947
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,656
Aunt, don't try to persuade us anymore

948
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,176
We will rely on ourselves

949
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,320
This is our principle

950
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,256
Zimei

951
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,696
Your brothers are going to go to work

952
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,976
This time we can't accompany you to play

953
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,720
Next time, okay

954
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,016
Let's go

955
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,000
Goodbye aunt

956
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,376
Wait a minute

957
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,720
Here

958
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,616
Take these all of these buns

959
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,536
Older brother, you agreed that I would send you my grasshopper

960
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,760
Brother promised you, I will do it for sure
